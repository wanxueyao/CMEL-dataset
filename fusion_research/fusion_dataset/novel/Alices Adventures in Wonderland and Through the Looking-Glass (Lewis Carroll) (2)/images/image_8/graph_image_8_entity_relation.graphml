  <data key="d1">"The image is a black and white illustration depicting a lizard-like creature emerging from a chimney. The creature appears to be in a state of distress or surprise, with its body partially out of the chimney and its tail still inside. The creature's limbs are spread out, and it has a long, slender body with a pointed tail. The chimney itself is depicted with a sense of motion, as if the creature is being expelled forcefully. There are wavy lines around the creature, suggesting smoke or steam emanating from the chimney. The overall atmosphere of the image conveys a sense of urgency and chaos, as if the creature has been unexpectedly ejected from the chimney."</data>
