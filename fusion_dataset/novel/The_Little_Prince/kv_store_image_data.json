In the background, there are two palm trees and a large rock formation, suggesting a desert or arid environment. The ground is a mix of yellow and white, with a few rocks scattered around.

Even as I was digging into my pocked to get out my revolver I made a running step back. But, at the noise I made, the snake let himself flow easily across the sand like the dying spray of a fountain, and, in no apparent hurry, disappeared, with a light metallic sound, among the stones. The little prince, however, replied once again: \"−−Exactly. You will see where my track begins, in the sand. You have nothing to do but wait for me there. I shall be there tonight.\" I was only twenty metres from the wall, and I still saw nothing. After a silence the little prince spoke again: \"You have good poison? You are sure that it will not make me suffer too long?\" I stopped in my tracks, my heart torn asunder; but still I did not understand. \"Now go away,\" said the little prince. \"I want to get down from the wall.\" ",
