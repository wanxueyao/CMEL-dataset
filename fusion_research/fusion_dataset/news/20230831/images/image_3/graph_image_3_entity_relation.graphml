  <data key="d1">"The image consists of two distinct scenes depicting the aftermath of Hurricane Idalia in Florida. The top image shows a flooded area with two buildings, each marked with numbers '14' and '15'. The building on the left has a yellow door and a window with a fish painting, while the building on the right has an orange door and a similar window. Both doors are partially submerged in water, indicating significant flooding. The surrounding area is also flooded, with vegetation emerging from the water. The bottom image depicts a flooded street lined with large trees covered in Spanish moss. The street is completely submerged, with only the tops of the trees and some road signs visible above the water. The overall atmosphere conveys the severity of the flood and its impact on the local environment."</data>
