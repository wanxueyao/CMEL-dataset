The queen is dressed in a vibrant, ornate costume with a blue dress adorned with gold and red patterns. She wears a large, triangular black hat with a golden crown on top. Her expression is stern and commanding, with her mouth set in a firm line. In her left hand, she holds a plate with several red tarts, each topped with what appears to be jam or jelly. To her right, there is a smaller figure, possibly a card soldier, who is also dressed in a similar style with a crown and holding a scepter. The background features a lush garden with green hedges shaped like hearts and flowers, adding to the fantastical atmosphere. Butterflies can be seen fluttering around, enhancing the magical setting. The overall mood of the image conveys a sense of authority and fantasy, typical of the story's themes.",

To the left of the king, a rabbit dressed in a suit stands holding a scroll. On the right side of the queen, a man in a tall hat and uniform stands guard.

There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it (‘which certainly was not here before,’ said Alice), and tied round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words ‘DRINK ME’ beautifully printed on it in large letters.
