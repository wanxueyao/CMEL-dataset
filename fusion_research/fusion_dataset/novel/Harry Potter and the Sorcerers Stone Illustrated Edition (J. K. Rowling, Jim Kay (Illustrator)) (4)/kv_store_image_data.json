Harry wished he could forget what he’d seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn’t. He started having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a łash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter. Dumbledore smiled. “You may ask me one more thing, however.” “What do you see when you look in the mirror?” “I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.” Harry stared. “One can never have enough socks,” said Dumbledore. “Another Christmas has come and gone and I didn’t get a single pair. People will insist on giving me books.” It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful. But then, he thought, as he shoved Scabbers oŀ his pillow, it had been quite a personal question. ",

In the foreground, there are sparse trees with bare branches on the left and right sides of the image, suggesting a winter or early spring setting. The ground is covered in snow, adding to the cold atmosphere. A body of water, possibly a lake or river, stretches across the middle of the image, reflecting the sky and contributing to the overall sense of tranquility. Above the water, a single red bird is flying, its bright color standing out against the muted background.

He asked if he knew how to get past Fluŀy—and he said something about Quirrell’s ‘hocus-pocus’—I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluŀy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through—” “So you mean the Stone’s only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to Snape?” said Hermione in alarm. “It’ll be gone by next Tuesday,” said Ron.

Excuses, alibis, and wild cover-up stories chased each other around Harry’s brain, each more feeble than the last. He couldn’t see how they were going to get out of trouble this time. They were cornered. How could they have been so stupid as to forget the Cloak? There was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the hings couldn’t have been worse. helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and Hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much. At last, Norbert was going...going...gone. They slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as their hands, now that Norbert was oŀ them. No more dragon—Malfoy in detention—what could spoil their happiness? The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they stepped into the corridor, Filch’s face loomed suddenly out of the darkness. “Well, well, well,” he whispered, “we are in trouble.” They’d left the Invisibility Cloak on top of the tower. ",
