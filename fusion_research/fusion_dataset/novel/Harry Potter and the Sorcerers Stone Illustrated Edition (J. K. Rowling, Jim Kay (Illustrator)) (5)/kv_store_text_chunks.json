He was still shaking.  \n\n“Snape wants the Stone for Voldemort...and Voldemort’s waiting in the forest...and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich....”  \n\n“Stop saying the name!” said Ron in a terriŁed whisper, as if he thought Voldemort could hear them.  \n\nHarry wasn’t listening.  \n\n“Firenze saved me, but he shouldn’t have done so....Bane was furious...he was talking about interfering with what the planets  say  is  going  to  happen....They  must  show  that Voldemort’s coming back....Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me....I suppose that’s written in the stars as well.”  \n\n“Will you stop saying the name!” Ron hissed.  \n\n“So all I’ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,” Harry went on feverishly, “then Voldemort will be able to come and Łnish me oŀ....Well, I suppose Bane’ll be happy.”  \n\nHermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort.  \n\n“Harry, everyone says Dumbledore’s the only one YouKnow-Who was ever afraid of. With Dumbledore around, YouKnow-Who won’t touch you. Anyway, who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune-telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says that’s a very imprecise branch of magic.”  \n\nThe sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They went to bed exhausted, their throats sore. But the night’s surprises weren’t over.  \n\nWhen Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his Invisibility Cloak folded neatly underneath them. There was a note pinned to it:  \n\nJust in case.  \n\n![](images/image_1.jpg)  \n\nn years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluŀy was still alive and well behind the locked door.  \n\nIt was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an Anti-Cheating spell.  \n\nThey had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tap-dance across a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuŀbox—points were given for how pretty the snuŀbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks  while  they  tried  to  remember  how  to  make  a Forgetfulness potion.  \n\nHarry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn’t sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded Łgure dripping blood in it.  \n\nMaybe it was because they hadn’t seen what Harry had seen in the forest, or because they didn’t have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn’t seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn’t keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn’t have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to.  \n\nTheir very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who’d invented self-stirring cauldrons and they’d be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn’t help cheering with the rest.  \n\n“That was far easier than I thought it would be,” said Hermione as they joined the crowds łocking out onto the sunny grounds. “I needn’t have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.”  \n\nHermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and łopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows.  \n\n“No more studying,” Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. “You could look more cheerful, Harry, we’ve got a week before we Łnd out how badly we’ve done, there’s no need to worry yet.”  \n\nHarry was rubbing his forehead.  \n\n“I wish I knew what this means!” he burst out angrily. “My scar keeps hurting—it’s happened before, but never as often as this.”  \n\n“Go to Madam Pomfrey,” Hermione suggested.  \n\n“I’m not ill,” said Harry. “I think it’s a warning...it means danger’s coming....”  \n\nRon couldn’t get worked up, it was too hot.  \n\n“Harry, relax, Hermione’s right, the Stone’s safe as long as Dumbledore’s around. Anyway, we’ve never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluŀy. He nearly had his leg ripped oŀ once, he’s not going to try it again",

Anyway, we’ve never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluŀy. He nearly had his leg ripped oŀ once, he’s not going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.”  \n\nHarry nodded, but he couldn’t shake oŀ a lurking feeling that there was something he’d forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, “That’s just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my TransŁguration notes before I remembered we’d done that one.”  \n\nHarry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn’t have anything to do with work, though. He watched an owl łutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluŀy...never...but—  \n\nHarry suddenly jumped to his feet.  \n\n“Where’re you going?” said Ron sleepily.  \n\n“I’ve just thought of something,” said Harry. He had turned white. “We’ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.”  \n\n“Why?” panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up.  \n\n“Don’t you think it’s a bit odd,” said Harry, scrambling up the grassy slope, “that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it’s against wizard law? Lucky they found Hagrid, don’t you think? Why didn’t I see it before?”  \n\n“What  are  you  talking  about?”  said  Ron,  but  Harry, sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn’t answer.  \n\nHagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl.  \n\n“Hullo,” he said, smiling. “Finished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?”  \n\n“Yes, please,” said Ron, but Harry cut him oŀ.  \n\n“No, we’re in a hurry. Hagrid, I’ve got to ask you something. You know that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?”  \n\n“Dunno,” said Hagrid casually, “he wouldn’ take his cloak oŀ.”  \n\nHe saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows.  \n\n“It’s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o’ funny folk in the Hog’s Head—that’s one o’ the pubs down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn’ he? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up.”  \n\nHarry sank down next to the bowl of peas.  \n\n“What did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?”  \n\n“Mighta come up,” said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember. “Yeah...he asked what I did, an’ I told him I was gamekeeper here....He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I look after...so I told him...an’ I said what I’d always really wanted was a dragon...an’ then...I can’ remember too well, ’cause he kept buyin’ me drinks....Let’s see...yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg an’ we could play cards fer it if I wanted...but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he didn’ want it ter go ter any old home....So I told him, after Fluŀy, a dragon would be easy....”  \n\n“And did he—did he seem interested in Fluŀy?” Harry asked, trying to keep his voice calm.  \n\n“Well—yeah—how many three-headed dogs d’yeh meet, even around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluŀy’s a piece o’ cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus’ play him a bit o’ music an’ he’ll go straight oŀ ter sleep—”  \n\nHagrid suddenly looked horriŁed.  \n\n“I shouldn’ta told yeh that!” he blurted out. “Forget I said it! Hey—where’re yeh goin’?”  \n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione didn’t speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds.  \n\n“We’ve got to go to Dumbledore,” said Harry. “Hagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluŀy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak—it must’ve been easy, once he’d got Hagrid drunk. I just hope Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might  back  us  up  if  Bane  doesn’t  stop  him.  Where’s Dumbledore’s oŃce?”  \n\nThey looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him.  \n\n“We’ll just have to—” Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall.  \n\n“What are you three doing inside?”  \n\nIt was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books",

The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn’t pick them up.  \n\n“How do you know—?” she spluttered.  \n\n“Professor, I think—I know—that Sn—that someone’s going to try and steal the Stone. I’ve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.”  \n\nShe eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion.  \n\n“Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,” she said Łnally. “I don’t know how you found out about the Stone, but rest  assured,  no  one  can  possibly  steal  it,  it’s  too  well protected.”  \n\n“But Professor—”  \n\n“Potter, I know what I’m talking about,” she said shortly. She bent down and gathered up the fallen books. “I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine.”  \n\nBut they didn’t.  \n\n“It’s tonight,” said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was out of earshot. “Snape’s going through the trapdoor tonight. He’s found out everything he needs, and now he’s got Dumbledore out of the way. He sent that note, I bet  the  Ministry  of  Magic  will  get  a  real  shock  when Dumbledore turns up.”  \n\n“But what can we—”  \n\nHermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round.  \n\nSnape was standing there.  \n\n“Good afternoon,” he said smoothly.  \n\nThey stared at him.  \n\n“You shouldn’t be inside on a day like this,” he said, with an odd, twisted smile.  \n\n“We were—” Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say.  \n\n“You want to be more careful,” said Snape. “Hanging around like this, people will think you’re up to something. And GryŃndor really can’t aŀord to lose any more points, can it?”  \n\nHarry łushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back.  \n\n“Be warned, Potter—any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.”  \n\nHe strode oŀ in the direction of the staŀroom.  \n\nOut on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others.  \n\n“Right, here’s what we’ve got to do,” he whispered urgently. “One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape—wait outside the staŀroom and follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you’d better do that.”  \n\n“Why me?”  \n\n“It’s obvious,” said Ron. “You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.” He put on a high voice, “‘Oh Professor Flitwick, I’m so worried, I think I got question fourteen $\\boldsymbol{b}$ wrong....’”  \n\n“Oh, shut up,” said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for Snape.  \n\n“And we’d better stay outside the third-łoor corridor,” Harry told Ron. “Come on.”  \n\nBut that part of the plan didn’t work. No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluŀy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper.  \n\n“I suppose you think you’re harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!” she stormed. “Enough of this nonsense! If I hear you’ve come anywhere near here again, I’ll take another Łfty points from GryŃndor! Yes, Weasley, from my own House!”  \n\nHarry and Ron went back to the common room. Harry had just said, “At least Hermione’s on Snape’s tail,” when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in.  \n\n“I’m sorry, Harry!” she wailed. “Snape came out and asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and I’ve only just got away, I don’t know where Snape went.”",

He was pale and his eyes were glittering.  \n\n“I’m going out of here tonight and I’m going to try and get to the Stone Łrst.”  \n\n“You’re mad!” said Ron.  \n\n“You can’t!” said Hermione. “After what McGonagall and Snape have said? You’ll be expelled!”  \n\n“SO WHAT?” Harry shouted. “Don’t you understand? If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort’s coming back! Haven’t you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over? There won’t be any Hogwarts to get expelled from! He’ll łatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn’t matter anymore, can’t you see? D’you think he’ll leave you and your families alone if GryŃndor wins the House Cup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I’ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to Łnd me there, it’s only dying a bit later than I would have, because I’m never going over to the Dark Side! I’m going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?”  \n\nHe glared at them.  \n\n“You’re right, Harry,” said Hermione in a small voice.  \n\n“I’ll use the Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry. “It’s just lucky I got it back.”  \n\n“But will it cover all three of us?” said Ron.  \n\n“All—all three of us?”  \n\n“Oh, come oŀ it, you don’t think we’d let you go alone?”  \n\n“Of course not,” said Hermione briskly. “How do you think you’d get to the Stone without us? I’d better go and look through my books, there might be something useful....”  \n\n“But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.”  \n\n“Not if I can help it,” said Hermione grimly. “Flitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They’re not throwing me out after that.”  \n\nAfter dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common  room.  Nobody  bothered  them;  none  of  the GryŃndors had anything to say to Harry any more, after all. This was the Łrst night he hadn’t been upset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry and Ron didn’t talk much. Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do.  \n\nSlowly, the room emptied as people drifted oŀ to bed.  \n\n“Better get the Cloak,” Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan Łnally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He pulled out the Cloak and then his eyes fell on the łute Hagrid had given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluŀy—he didn’t feel much like singing.  \n\nHe ran back down to the common room.  \n\n“We’d better put the Cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us—if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own—”  \n\n“What are you doing?” said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he’d been making another bid for freedom.  \n\n“Nothing, Neville, nothing,” said Harry, hurriedly putting the Cloak behind his back.  \n\nNeville stared at their guilty faces.  \n\n“You’re going out again,” he said.  \n\n“No, no, no,” said Hermione. “No, we’re not. Why don’t you go to bed, Neville?”  \n\nHarry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They couldn’t aŀord to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluŀy to sleep.  \n\n“You can’t go out,” said Neville, “you’ll be caught again. GryŃndor will be in even more trouble.”  \n\n“You don’t understand,” said Harry, “this is important.”  \n\nBut Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate.  \n\n“I won’t let you do it,” he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole. “I’ll—I’ll Łght you!”  \n\n“Neville,” Ron exploded, “get away from that hole and don’t be an idiot—”  \n\n“Don’t you call me an idiot!” said Neville. “I don’t think you should be breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to people!”  \n\n“Yes, but not to us,” said Ron in exasperation. “Neville, you don’t know what you’re doing.”  \n\nHe took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt out of sight.  \n\n“Go on then, try and hit me!” said Neville, raising his Łsts. “I’m ready!”  \n\nHarry turned to Hermione.  \n\n“Do something,” he",

His  legs  sprang together. His whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell łat on his face, stiŀ as a board.  \n\nHermione ran to turn him over. Neville’s jaws were jammed together so he couldn’t speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror.  \n\n“What’ve you done to him?” Harry whispered.  \n\n“It’s the full Body-Bind,” said Hermione miserably. “Oh, Neville, I’m so sorry.”  \n\n“We had to, Neville, no time to explain,” said Harry.  \n\n“You’ll understand later, Neville,” said Ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the Invisibility Cloak.  \n\nBut leaving Neville lying motionless on the łoor didn’t feel like a very good omen. In their nervous state, every statue’s shadow  looked  like  Filch,  every  distant  breath  of  wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them.  \n\nAt the foot of the Łrst set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. Norris skulking near the top.  \n\n“Oh, let’s kick her, just this once,” Ron whispered in Harry’s ear, but Harry shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn’t do anything.  \n\nThey  didn’t  meet  anyone  else  until  they  reached  the staircase up to the third łoor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would trip.  \n\n“Who’s there?” he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. He narrowed his wicked black eyes. “Know you’re there, even if I can’t see you. Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?”  \n\nHe rose up in the air and łoated there, squinting at them.  \n\n“Should  call  Filch,  I  should,  if  something’s  a-creeping around unseen.”  \n\nHarry had a sudden idea.  \n\n“Peeves,” he said, in a hoarse whisper, “the Bloody Baron has his own reasons for being invisible.”  \n\nPeeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in time and hovered about a foot oŀ the stairs.  \n\n“So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, sir,” he said greasily. My mistake, my mistake—I didn’t see you—of course I didn’t, you’re invisible—forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.”  \n\n“I have business here, Peeves,” croaked Harry. “Stay away from this place tonight.”  \n\n“I will, sir, I most certainly will,” said Peeves, rising up in the air again. “Hope your business goes well, Baron, I’ll not bother you.”  \n\nAnd he scooted oŀ.  \n\n“Brilliant, Harry!” whispered Ron.  \n\nA few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-łoor corridor—and the door was already ajar.  \n\n“Well, there you are,” Harry said quietly, “Snape’s already got past Fluŀy.”  \n\nSeeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them. Underneath the Cloak, Harry turned to the other two.  \n\n“If you want to go back, I won’t blame you,” he said. “You can take the Cloak, I won’t need it now.”  \n\n“Don’t be stupid,” said Ron.  \n\n“We’re coming,” said Hermione.  \n\nHarry pushed the door open.  \n\nAs the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of the dog’s noses sniŀed madly in their direction, even though it couldn’t see them.  \n\n“What’s that at its feet?” Hermione whispered.  \n\n“Looks like a harp,” said Ron. “Snape must have left it there.”  \n\n“It must wake up the moment you stop playing,” said Harry. “Well, here goes...”  \n\nHe put Hagrid’s łute to his lips and blew. It wasn’t really a tune, but from the Łrst note the beast’s eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, the dog’s growls ceased—it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.  \n\n“Keep playing,” Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the Cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog’s hot, smelly breath as they approached the giant heads.  \n\n“I think we’ll be able to pull the door open,” said Ron, peering over the dog’s back. “Want to go Łrst, Hermione?”  \n\n“No, I don’t!”  \n\n“All right.” Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog’s legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open.  \n\n“What can you see?” Hermione said anxiously.  \n\n“",

He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open.  \n\n“What can you see?” Hermione said anxiously.  \n\n“Nothing—just black—there’s no way of climbing down, we’ll just have to drop.”  \n\nHarry, who was still playing the łute, waved at Ron to get his attention and pointed at himself.  \n\n“You want to go Łrst? Are you sure?” said Ron. “I don’t know how deep this thing goes. Give the łute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.”  \n\nHarry handed the łute over. In the few seconds’ silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep sleep.  \n\nHarry  climbed  over  it  and  looked  down  through  the trapdoor. There was no sign of the bottom.  \n\nHe lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his Łngertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, “If anything happens to me, don’t follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?”  \n\n“Right,” said Ron.  \n\n“See you in a minute, I hope....”  \n\nAnd Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down, down and—  \n\nFLUMP. With a funny, muńed sort of thump he landed on something soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant.  \n\n“It’s okay!” he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, “it’s a soft landing, you can jump!”  \n\nRon followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.  \n\n“What’s this stuŀ?” were his Łrst words.  \n\n“Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it’s here to break the fall. Come on, Hermione!”  \n\nThe distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry’s  \n\nother side.  \n\n“We must be miles under the school,” she said.  \n\n“Lucky this plant thing’s here, really,” said Ron.  \n\n“Lucky!” shrieked Hermione. “Look at you both!”  \n\nShe leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.  \n\nHermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a Łrm grip on her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant oŀ them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound around them.  \n\n“Stop moving!” Hermione ordered them. “I know what this is—it’s Devil’s Snare!”  \n\n“Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a great help,” snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck.  \n\n“Shut up, I’m trying to remember how to kill it!” said Hermione.  \n\n“Well, hurry up, I can’t breathe!” Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest.  \n\n“Devil’s Snare, Devil’s Snare...what did Professor Sprout say? —it likes the dark and the damp—”  \n\n“So light a Łre!” Harry choked.  \n\n“Yes—of course—but there’s no wood!” Hermione cried, wringing her hands.  \n\n“HAVE YOU GONE MAD?” Ron bellowed. “ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?”  \n\n“Oh, right!” said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell łames she had used on Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth. Wriggling and łailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free.  \n\n“Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,” said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat oŀ his face.  \n\n“Yeah,” said Ron, “and lucky Harry doesn’t lose his head in a crisis—‘there’s no wood,’ honestly.”  \n\n“This way,” said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward.  \n\nAll they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards’ bank. If they met a dragon,  a  fully-grown  dragon—Norbert  had  been  bad enough...  \n\n“Can you hear something?” Ron whispered.  \n\nHarry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead.  \n\n“Do you think it’s a ghost?”  \n\n“I don’t know...sounds like wings to me.”  \n\n“There’s light ahead—I can see something moving.”  \n\nThey reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber",

A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead.  \n\n“Do you think it’s a ghost?”  \n\n“I don’t know...sounds like wings to me.”  \n\n“There’s light ahead—I can see something moving.”  \n\nThey reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small, jewel-bright birds, łuttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door.  \n\n“Do you think they’ll attack us if we cross the room?” said Ron.  \n\n“Probably,” said Harry. “They don’t look very vicious, but I suppose if they all swooped down at once...well, there’s no other choice...I’ll run.”  \n\nHe took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted across the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked.  \n\nThe other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn’t budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora Charm.  \n\n“Now what?” said Ron.  \n\n“These birds...they can’t be here just for decoration,” said Hermione.  \n\nThey watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering— glittering?  \n\n“They’re not birds!” Harry said suddenly. “They’re keys! Winged keys—look carefully. So that must mean...” he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the łock of keys. “...yes—look! Broomsticks! We’ve got to catch the key to the door!”  \n\n“But there are hundreds of them!”  \n\nRon examined the lock on the door.  \n\n“We’re looking for a big, old-fashioned one—probably silver, like the handle.”  \n\nThey each seized a broomstick and kicked oŀ into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one.  \n\nNot for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He had a knack for spotting things other people didn’t. After a minute’s weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuŀed roughly into the keyhole.  \n\n“That one!” he called to the others. “That big one—there— no,  there—with  bright  blue  wings—the  feathers  are  all crumpled on one side.”  \n\nRon  went  speeding  in  the  direction  that  Harry  was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell oŀ his broom.  \n\n“We’ve got to close in on it!” Harry called, not taking his eyes oŀ the key with the damaged wing. “Ron, you come at it from above—Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down—and I’ll try and catch it. Right, NOW!”  \n\nRon dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned  it  against  the  stone  with  one  hand.  Ron  and Hermione’s cheers echoed around the high chamber.  \n\nThey landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned —it worked. The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took łight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice.  \n\n“Ready?” Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They nodded. He pulled the door open.  \n\nThe next chamber was so dark they couldn’t see anything at all. But as they stepped into it, light suddenly łooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight.  \n\nThey were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly—the towering white chessmen had no faces.  \n\n“Now what do we do?” Harry whispered.  \n\n“It’s obvious, isn’t it?” said Ron. “We’ve got to play our way across the room.”  \n\nBehind the white pieces they could see another door.  \n\n“How?” said Hermione nervously.  \n\n“I think,” said Ron, “we’re going to have to be chessmen.”  \n\nHe walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight’s horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.  \n\n“Do we—er—have to join you to get across?”  \n\nThe black knight nodded. Ron turned to the other two.  \n\n“This needs thinking about....” he said. “I suppose we’ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces....”  \n\nHarry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said, “Now, don’t be oŀended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess—”  \n\n“We’re not oŀended,” said Harry quickly. “Just tell us what to do.”  \n\n“Well,  Harry,  you  take  the  place  of",

Finally he said, “Now, don’t be oŀended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess—”  \n\n“We’re not oŀended,” said Harry quickly. “Just tell us what to do.”  \n\n“Well,  Harry,  you  take  the  place  of  that  bishop,  and Hermione, you go there instead of that castle.”  \n\n“What about you?”  \n\n“I’m going to be a knight,” said Ron.  \n\nThe chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked oŀ the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took.  \n\n“White always plays Łrst in chess,” said Ron, peering across the board. “Yes...look...”  \n\nA white pawn had moved forward two squares.  \n\nRon started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he sent them. Harry’s knees were trembling. What if they lost?  \n\n“Harry—move diagonally four squares to the right.”  \n\nTheir Łrst real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white queen smashed him to the łoor and dragged him oŀ the board, where he lay quite still, facedown.  \n\n“Had to let that happen,” said Ron, looking shaken. “Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on.”  \n\nEvery time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall. Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger. He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones.  \n\n“We’re nearly there,” he muttered suddenly. “Let me think— let me think...”  \n\nThe white queen turned her blank face toward him.  \n\n“Yes...” said Ron softly, “it’s the only way...I’ve got to be taken.”  \n\n“NO!” Harry and Hermione shouted.  \n\n“That’s chess!” snapped Ron. “You’ve got to make some sacriŁces! I’ll make my move and she’ll take me—that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!”  \n\n“But—”  \n\n“Do you want to stop Snape or not?”  \n\n“Ron—”  \n\n“Look, if you don’t hurry up, he’ll already have the Stone!”  \n\nThere was no alternative.  \n\n“Ready?” Ron called, his face pale but determined. “Here I go —now, don’t hang around once you’ve won.”  \n\nHe stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the łoor—Hermione screamed but stayed on her square—the white queen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he’d been knocked out.  \n\nShaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left.  \n\nThe white king took oŀ his crown and threw it at Harry’s feet. They had won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway.  \n\n“What if he’s—?”  \n\n“He’ll be all right,” said Harry, trying to convince himself. “What do you reckon’s next?”  \n\n“We’ve had Sprout’s, that was the Devil’s Snare; Flitwick must’ve put charms on the keys; McGonagall transŁgured the chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrell’s spell, and Snape’s...”  \n\nThey had reached another door.  \n\n“All right?” Harry whispered.  \n\n“Go on.”  \n\nHarry pushed it open.  \n\nA disgusting smell Łlled their nostrils, making both of them pull their robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, łat on the łoor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head.  \n\n“I’m glad we didn’t have to Łght that one,” Harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. “Come on, I can’t breathe.”  \n\nHe pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look  at  what  came  next—but  there  was  nothing  very frightening in here, just a table with seven diŀerently shaped bottles standing on it in a line.  \n\n“Snape’s,” said Harry. “What do we have to do?”  \n\nThey stepped over the threshold, and immediately a Łre sprang up behind them in the doorway. It wasn’t ordinary Łre either; it was purple. At the same instant, black łames shot up in the doorway leading onward. They were trapped.  \n\n“Look!” Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Harry looked over her shoulder to read it:  \n\nDanger lies before you, while safety lies behind, Two of us will help you, whichever you would find, One among us seven will let you move ahead, Another will transport the drinker back instead, Two among our number hold only nettle wine, Three of us are killers, waiting hidden in line.

A lot of the greatest wizards haven’t got an ounce of logic, they’d be stuck in here forever.”  \n\n“But so will we, won’t we?”  \n\n“Of course not,” said Hermione. “Everything we need is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely through the black Łre, and one will get us back through the purple.”  \n\n“But how do we know which to drink?”  \n\n“Give me a minute.”  \n\nHermione read the paper several times. Then she walked up and  down  the  line  of  bottles,  muttering  to  herself  and pointing at them. At last, she clapped her hands.  \n\n“Got it,” she said. “The smallest bottle will get us through the black Łre—toward the Stone.”  \n\nHarry looked at the tiny bottle.  \n\n“There’s only enough there for one of us,” he said. “That’s hardly one swallow.”  \n\nThey looked at each other.  \n\n“Which one will get you back through the purple łames?”  \n\nHermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line.  \n\n“You drink that,” said Harry. “No, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab brooms from the łying-key room, they’ll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluŀy—go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold Snape oŀ for a while, but I’m no match for him, really.”  \n\n“But Harry—what if You-Know-Who’s with him?”  \n\n“Well—I was lucky once, wasn’t I?” said Harry, pointing at his scar. “I might get lucky again.”  \n\nHermione’s lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her arms around him.  \n\n“Hermione!”  \n\n“Harry—you’re a great wizard, you know.”  \n\n“I’m not as good as you,” said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of him.  \n\n“Me!” said Hermione. “Books! And cleverness! There are more important things—friendship and bravery and—oh Harry—be careful!”  \n\n“You drink Łrst,” said Harry. “You are sure which is which, aren’t you?”  \n\n“Positive,” said Hermione. She took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered.  \n\n“It’s not poison?” said Harry anxiously.  \n\n“No—but it’s like ice.”  \n\n“Quick, go, before it wears oŀ.”  \n\n“Good luck—take care—”  \n\n“GO!”  \n\nHermione turned and walked straight through the purple Łre.  \n\nHarry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He turned to face the black łames.  \n\n“Here I come,” he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp.  \n\nIt was indeed as though ice was łooding his body. He put the bottle down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black łames licking his body, but couldn’t feel them—for a moment he could see nothing but dark Łre—then he was on the other side, in the last chamber.  \n\nThere was already someone there—but it wasn’t Snape. It wasn’t even Voldemort.  \n\n![](images/image_2.jpg)  \n\n# I  \n\n# t was Quirrell.  \n\n“You!” gasped Harry.  \n\nQuirrell smiled. His face wasn’t twitching at all.  \n\n“Me,” he said calmly. “I wondered whether I’d be meeting you here, Potter.”  \n\n“But I thought—Snape—”  \n\n“Severus?”  Quirrell  laughed,  and  it  wasn’t  his  usual quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp. “Yes, Severus does seem the type, doesn’t he? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?”  \n\nHarry couldn’t take it in. This couldn’t be true, it couldn’t.  \n\n“But Snape tried to kill me!”  \n\n“No, no, no. I tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set Łre to Snape at that Quidditch match. She broke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds and I’d have got you oŀ that broom. I’d  have  managed  it  before  then  if  Snape  hadn’t  been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you.”  \n\n“Snape was trying to save me?”  \n\n“Of course,” said Quirrell coolly. “Why do you think he wanted to referee your next match",

He was trying to make sure  I  didn’t  do  it  again.  Funny,  really...he  needn’t  have bothered. I couldn’t do anything with Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop GryŃndor  from  winning,  he  did  make  himself unpopular...and what a waste of time, when after all that, I’m going to kill you tonight.”  \n\nQuirrell snapped his Łngers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry.  \n\n“You’re too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the school on Halloween like that, for all I knew you’d seen me coming to look at what was guarding the Stone.”  \n\n“You let the troll in?”  \n\n“Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls—you must have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went straight to the third łoor to head me oŀ—and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn’t even manage to bite Snape’s leg oŀ properly.  \n\n“Now,  wait  quietly,  Potter.  I  need  to  examine  this interesting mirror.”  \n\nIt was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It was the Mirror of Erised.  \n\n“This mirror is the key to Łnding the Stone,” Quirrell murmured,  tapping  his  way  around  the  frame.  “Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like this...but he’s in London...I’ll be far away by the time he gets back....”  \n\nAll Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror.  \n\n“I saw you and Snape in the forest—” he blurted out.  \n\n“Yes,” said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back. “He was on to me by that time, trying to Łnd out how far I’d got. He suspected me all along. Tried to frighten me—as though he could, when I had Lord Voldemort on my side....”  \n\nQuirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it.  \n\n“I see the Stone...I’m presenting it to my master...but where is it?”  \n\nHarry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn’t give. He had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror.  \n\n“But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.”  \n\n“Oh, he does,” said Quirrell casually, “heavens, yes. He was at Hogwarts with your father, didn’t you know? They loathed each other. But he never wanted you dead.”  \n\n“But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing—I thought Snape was threatening you....”  \n\nFor the Łrst time, a spasm of fear łitted across Quirrell’s face.  \n\n“Sometimes,” he said, $^\\alpha_{\\mathrm{I}}$ Łnd it hard to follow my master’s instructions—he is a great wizard and I am weak—”  \n\n“You mean he was there in the classroom with you?” Harry gasped.  \n\n“He is with me wherever I go,” said Quirrell quietly. “I met him when I traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it....Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me.” Quirrell shivered suddenly. “He does not forgive mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the Stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased. He punished me...decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me....”  \n\nQuirrell’s voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon Alley—how could he have been so stupid? He’d seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron.  \n\nQuirrell cursed under his breath.  \n\n“I don’t understand...is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break it?”  \n\nHarry’s mind was racing.  \n\nWhat I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he thought, is to Łnd the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I should see myself Łnding it—which means I’ll see where it’s hidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I’m up to?  \n\nHe tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles  \n\nwere too tight: he tripped and fell over. Quirrell ignored him.   \nHe was still talking to himself.  \n\n“What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!”  \n\nAnd to Harry’s horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to",

Harry got slowly to his feet.  \n\n“Come here,” Quirrell repeated. “Look in the mirror and tell me what you see.”  \n\nHarry walked toward him.  \n\nI must lie, he thought desperately. I must look and lie about what I see, that’s all.  \n\nQuirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell’s turban. He closed his eyes, stepped in front of the mirror, and opened them again.  \n\nHe saw his rełection, pale and scared-looking at Łrst. But a moment later, the rełection smiled at him. It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood-red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its pocket—and as it did so, Harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket. Somehow— incredibly—he’d gotten the Stone.  \n\n“Well?” said Quirrell impatiently. “What do you see?”  \n\nHarry screwed up his courage.  \n\n“I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,” he invented. “I—I’ve won the House Cup for GryŃndor.”  \n\nQuirrell cursed again.  \n\n“Get out of the way,” he said. As Harry moved aside, he felt the Sorcerer’s Stone against his leg. Dare he make a break for it?  \n\nBut he hadn’t walked Łve paces before a high voice spoke, though Quirrell wasn’t moving his lips.  \n\n“He lies...He lies...”  \n\n“Potter, come back here!” Quirrell shouted. “Tell me the truth! What did you just see?”  \n\nThe high voice spoke again.  \n\n“Let me speak to him...face-to-face....”  \n\n“Master, you are not strong enough!”  \n\n“I have strength enough...for this....”  \n\nHarry felt as if Devil’s Snare was rooting him to the spot. He couldn’t move a muscle. PetriŁed, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. Quirrell’s head looked strangely small without it. Then he turned slowly on the spot.  \n\nHarry would have screamed, but he couldn’t make a sound. Where there should have been a back to Quirrell’s head, there was a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake.  \n\n“Harry Potter...” it whispered.  \n\nHarry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn’t move.  \n\n“See what I have become?” the face said. “Mere shadow and vapor...I have form only when I can share another’s body...but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds....Unicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks...you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the forest...and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be able to create a body of my own....Now...why don’t you give me that Stone in your pocket?”  \n\nSo he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry’s legs. He stumbled backward.  \n\n“Don’t be a fool,” snarled the face. “Better save your own life and  join  me...or  you’ll  meet  the  same  end  as  your parents....They died begging me for mercy....”  \n\n“LIAR!” Harry shouted suddenly.  \n\nQuirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could still see him. The evil face was now smiling.  \n\n“How touching...” it hissed. “I always value bravery....Yes, boy, your parents were brave....I killed your father Łrst, and he put up a courageous Łght...but your mother needn’t have died...she was trying to protect you....Now give me the Stone, unless you want her to have died in vain.”  \n\n“NEVER!”  \n\nHarry  sprang  toward  the  łame  door,  but  Voldemort screamed “SEIZE HIM!” and the next second, Harry felt Quirrell’s hand close on his wrist. At once, a needle-sharp pain seared across Harry’s scar; his head felt as though it was about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all his might, and to his surprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head lessened—he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain, looking at his Łngers— they were blistering before his eyes.  \n\n“Seize him! SEIZE HIM!” shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean oŀ his feet, landing on top of him, both hands around Harry’s neck—Harry’s scar was almost blinding him with pain, yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony.  \n\n“Master, I cannot hold him—my hands—my hands!”",

Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry oŀ—the pain in Harry’s head was building—he couldn’t see—he could only hear Quirrell’s terrible shrieks and Voldemort’s yells of, “KILL HIM! KILL HIM!” and other voices, maybe in Harry’s own head, crying, “Harry! Harry!”  \n\nHe felt Quirrell’s arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blackness, down...down...down...  \n\nSomething gold was glinting just above him. The Snitch! He tried to catch it, but his arms were too heavy.  \n\nHe blinked. It wasn’t the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How strange.  \n\nHe blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view above him.  \n\n“Good afternoon, Harry,” said Dumbledore.  \n\nHarry stared at him. Then he remembered: “Sir! The Stone! It was Quirrell! He’s got the Stone! Sir, quick—”  \n\n“Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,” said Dumbledore. “Quirrell does not have the Stone.”  \n\n“Then who does? Sir, I—”  \n\n“Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.”  \n\nHarry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in the hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop.  \n\n“Tokens  from  your  friends  and  admirers,”  said Dumbledore,  beaming.  “What  happened  down  in  the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and conŁscated it.”  \n\n“How long have I been in here?”  \n\n“Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most  relieved  you  have  come  round,  they  have  been extremely worried.”  \n\n“But sir, the Stone—”  \n\n“I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived in time to prevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, I must say.”  \n\n“You got there? You got Hermione’s owl?”  \n\n“We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell oŀ you—”  \n\n“It was you.”  \n\n“I feared I might be too late.”  \n\n“You nearly were, I couldn’t have kept him oŀ the Stone much longer—”  \n\n“Not the Stone, boy, you—the eŀort involved nearly killed you. For one terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has been destroyed.”  \n\n“Destroyed?” said Harry blankly. “But your friend—Nicolas Flamel—”  \n\n“Oh, you know about Nicolas?” said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted. “You did do the thing properly, didn’t you? Well, Nicolas and I have had a little chat, and agreed it’s all for the best.”  \n\n“But that means he and his wife will die, won’t they?”  \n\n“They have enough Elixir stored to set their aŀairs in order and then, yes, they will die.”  \n\nDumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry’s face.  \n\n“To one as young as you, I’m sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. As much money and life as you could want!

The two things most human beings would choose above all—the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.”  \n\nHarry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling.  \n\n“Sir?” said Harry. “I’ve been thinking...Sir—even if the Stone’s gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who—”  \n\n“Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.”  \n\n“Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort’s going to try other ways of coming back, isn’t he? I mean, he hasn’t gone, has he?”  \n\n“No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share...not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to Łght what seems a losing battle next time—and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never return to power.”  \n\nHarry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt. Then he said, “Sir, there are some other things I’d like to know, if you can tell me...things I want to know the truth about....”  \n\n“The truth.” Dumbledore sighed. “It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case I beg you’ll forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie.”  \n\n“Well...Voldemort  said  that  he  only  killed  my  mother because she tried to stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in the Łrst place?”  \n\nDumbledore sighed very deeply this time.  \n\n“Alas, the Łrst thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not now. You will know, one day...put it from your mind for now, Harry. When you are older...I know you hate to hear this...when you are ready, you will know.”  \n\nAnd Harry knew it would be no good to argue.  \n\n“But why couldn’t Quirrell touch me?”  \n\n“Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn’t realize that love as powerful as your mother’s for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign...to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.”  \n\nDumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet. When he had found his voice again, Harry said, “And the Invisibility Cloak—do you know who sent it to me?”  \n\n“Ah—your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought you might like it.” Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled. “Useful things...your father used it mainly for sneaking oŀ to the kitchens to steal food when he was here.”  \n\n“And there’s something else...” “Fire away.” “Quirrell said Snape—” “Professor Snape, Harry.”  \n\n“Yes, him—Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father. Is that true?”  \n\n“Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and Mr. Malfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive.”  \n\n“What?”   \n“He saved his life.”   \n“What?”  \n\n“Yes...” said Dumbledore dreamily. “Funny, the way people’s minds work, isn’t it? Professor Snape couldn’t bear being in your father’s debt....I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even. Then he could go back to hating your father’s memory in peace....”  \n\nHarry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he stopped.  \n\n“And sir, there’s one more thing...”  \n\n“Just the one?”  \n\n“How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?”  \n\n“Ah, now, I’m glad you asked me that. It was one of my more brilliant  ideas,  and  between  you  and  me,  that’s  saying something. You see, only one who wanted to Łnd the Stone— Łnd it, but not use it—would be able to get it, otherwise they’d just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. My brain surprises even me sometimes....Now, enough questions. I suggest you make a start on these sweets. Ah! Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans!

I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit-łavored one, and since then I’m afraid I’ve rather lost my liking for them—but I think I’ll be safe with a nice toŀee, don’t you?”  \n\nHe smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth. Then he choked and said, “Alas! Ear wax!”  \n\nMadam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict.  \n\n“Just Łve minutes,” Harry pleaded.  \n\n“Absolutely not.”  \n\n“You let Professor Dumbledore in....”  \n\n“Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite diŀerent. You need rest.”  \n\n“I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on, Madam Pomfrey...”  \n\n“Oh, very well,” she said. “But Łve minutes only.”  \n\nAnd she let Ron and Hermione in.  \n\n“Harry!”  \n\nHermione looked ready to łing her arms around him again, but Harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore.  \n\n“Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to—Dumbledore was so worried—”  \n\n“The whole school’s talking about it,” said Ron. “What really happened?”  \n\nIt was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors. Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione were a very good audience; they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told them what was under Quirrell’s turban, Hermione screamed out loud.  \n\n“So the Stone’s gone?” said Ron Łnally. “Flamel’s just going to die?”  \n\n“That’s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that—what was it?—‘to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.’”  \n\n“I always said he was oŀ his rocker,” said Ron, looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was.  \n\n“So what happened to you two?” said Harry.  \n\n“Well, I got back all right,” said Hermione. “I brought Ron round—that took a while—and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall—he already knew—he just said, ‘Harry’s gone after him, hasn’t he?’ and hurtled oŀ to the third łoor.”  \n\n“D’you think he meant you to do it?” said Ron. “Sending you your father’s Cloak and everything?”  \n\n“Well,” Hermione exploded, “if he did—I mean to say—that’s terrible—you could have been killed.”  \n\n“No, it isn’t,” said Harry thoughtfully. “He’s a funny man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I don’t think it was an accident he let me Łnd out how the mirror worked. It’s almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could....”  \n\n“Yeah, Dumbledore’s oŀ his rocker, all right,” said Ron proudly. “Listen, you’ve got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and Slytherin won, of course— you missed the last Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you—but the food’ll be good.”  \n\nAt that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.  \n\n“You’ve had nearly Łfteen minutes, now OUT,” she said Łrmly.  \n\nAfter a good night’s sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal.  \n\n“I want to go to the feast,” he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes. “I can, can’t I?”  \n\n“Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go,” she  said  sniŃly,  as  though  in  her  opinion  Professor Dumbledore didn’t realize how risky feasts could be. “And you have another visitor.”  \n\n“Oh, good,” said Harry. “Who is it?”  \n\nHagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual when he was indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed. He sat down next to Harry, took one look at him, and burst into tears.  \n\n“It’s—all—my—ruddy—fault!” he sobbed, his face in his hands. “I told the evil git how ter get past Fluŀy! I told him! It was the only thing he didn’t know, an’ I told him! Yeh could’ve died! All fer a dragon egg! I’ll never drink again! I should be chucked out an’ made ter live as a Muggle!”  \n\n“Hagrid!” said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into his beard. “Hagrid, he’d have found out somehow, this is Voldemort we’re talking about, he’d have found out even if you hadn’t told him.”  \n\n“Yeh could’ve died!” sobbed Hagrid. “An’ don’ say the name!”  \n\n“VOLDEMORT!”  Harry  bellowed,",

Please cheer up, Hagrid, we saved the Stone, it’s gone, he can’t use it. Have a Chocolate Frog, I’ve got loads....”  \n\nHagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, “That reminds me. I’ve got yeh a present.”  \n\n“It’s not a stoat sandwich, is it?” said Harry anxiously, and at last Hagrid gave a weak chuckle.  \n\n“Nah. Dumbledore gave me the day oŀ yesterday ter Łx it. ’Course, he shoulda sacked me instead—anyway, got yeh this...”  \n\nIt seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book. Harry opened it curiously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father.  \n\n“Sent owls oŀ ter all yer parents’ old school friends, askin’ fer photos...knew yeh didn’ have any...d’yeh like it?”  \n\nHarry couldn’t speak, but Hagrid understood.  \n\nHarry made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night. He had been held up by Madam Pomfrey’s fussing about, insisting on giving him one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin’s winning the House Cup for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table.  \n\nWhen Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the GryŃndor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him.  \n\nFortunately,  Dumbledore  arrived  moments  later.  The babble died away.  \n\n“Another year gone!” Dumbledore said cheerfully. “And I must trouble you with an old man’s wheezing wańe before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were...you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts....  \n\n“Now,  as  I  understand  it,  the  House  Cup  here  needs awarding,  and  the  points  stand  thus:  In  fourth  place, GryŃndor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Huńepuŀ, with three hundred and Łfty-two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy-two.”  \n\nA storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table. Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table. It was a sickening sight.  \n\n“Yes, yes, well done, Slytherin,” said Dumbledore. “However, recent events must be taken into account.”  \n\nThe room went very still. The Slytherins’ smiles faded a little.  \n\n“Ahem,” said Dumbledore. “I have a few last-minute points to dish out. Let me see. Yes...  \n\n“First—to Mr. Ronald Weasley...”  \n\nRon went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.  \n\n“...for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award GryŃndor House Łfty points.”  \n\nGryŃndor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other prefects, “My brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall’s giant chess set!”  \n\nAt last there was silence again.  \n\n“Second—to Miss Hermione Granger...for the use of cool logic in the face of Łre, I award GryŃndor House Łfty points.”  \n\nHermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears. GryŃndors up and down the table were beside themselves—they were a hundred points up.  \n\n“Third—to Mr. Harry Potter...” said Dumbledore. The room went deadly quiet. “...for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award GryŃndor House sixty points.”  \n\nThe din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that GryŃndor now had four hundred  and  seventy-two  points—exactly  the  same  as Slytherin.  They  had  tied  for  the  House  Cup—if  only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.  \n\nDumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent.  \n\n“There are all kinds of courage,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom.”  \n\nSomeone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the",

I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom.”  \n\nSomeone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the GryŃndor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He had never won so much as a point for GryŃndor before. Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn’t have looked more stunned and horriŁed if he’d just had the Body-Bind Curse put on him.  \n\n“Which means,” Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even Ravenclaw and Huńepuŀ were celebrating the  downfall  of  Slytherin,  “we  need  a  little  change  of decoration.”  \n\nHe clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering GryŃndor lion took its place. Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall’s hand, with a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry’s eye and Harry knew at once that Snape’s feelings toward him hadn’t changed one jot. This didn’t worry Harry. It seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts.  \n\nIt was the best evening of Harry’s life, better than winning at  Quidditch,  or  Christmas,  or  knocking  out  mountain trolls...he would never, ever forget tonight.  \n\nHarry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the Łrst years. Even Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you couldn’t have everything in life.  \n\nAnd suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Neville’s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the holidays (“I always hope they’ll forget to give us these,” said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the łeet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling oŀ their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and threequarters at King’s Cross station.  \n\nIt took quite a while for them all to get oŀ the platform. A wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didn’t attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles.  \n\n“You must come and stay this summer,” said Ron, “both of you—I’ll send you an owl.”  \n\n“Thanks,” said Harry, “I’ll need something to look forward to.”  \n\nPeople jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world. Some of them called:  \n\n“Bye, Harry!”  \n\n“See you, Potter!”  \n\n“Still famous,” said Ron, grinning at him.  \n\n“Not where I’m going, I promise you,” said Harry.  \n\nHe,  Ron,  and  Hermione  passed  through  the  gateway together.  \n\n“There he is, Mum, there he is, look!”  \n\nIt was Ginny Weasley, Ron’s younger sister, but she wasn’t pointing at Ron.  \n\n“Harry Potter!” she squealed. “Look, Mum! I can see—”  \n\n“Be quiet, Ginny, and it’s rude to point.”  \n\nMrs. Weasley smiled down at them.  \n\n“Busy year?” she said.  \n\n“Very,” said Harry. “Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs. Weasley.”  \n\n“Oh, it was nothing, dear.”  \n\n“Ready, are you?”  \n\nIt was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, looking terriŁed at the very sight of Harry.  \n\n“You must be Harry’s family!” said Mrs. Weasley.  \n\n“In a manner of speaking,” said Uncle Vernon. “Hurry up, boy, we haven’t got all day.” He walked away.  \n\nHarry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione.  \n\n“See you over the summer, then.”  \n\n“Hope  you  have—er—a  good  holiday,”  said  Hermione, looking uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant.  \n\n“Oh, I will,” said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over his face. “They don’t know we’re not allowed to use magic at home. I’m going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer",
