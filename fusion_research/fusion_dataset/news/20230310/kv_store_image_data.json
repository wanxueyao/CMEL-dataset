The main focus is on a house or cabin with a steeply pitched roof, which is almost entirely buried under a thick layer of snow. The snow has accumulated to such an extent that it reaches the top of the windows and doors, indicating a significant amount of snowfall. The house has a wooden exterior with a brownish hue, and there are several windows visible, some of which are partially obscured by the snow. The entrance door is also partially covered, making it difficult to access. Surrounding the house are tall pine trees, their branches also laden with snow, creating a serene and somewhat isolated atmosphere.

The jump is larger than other forecasters, like the Congressional Budget Office, have projected. It is driven by rising costs of servicing the national debt as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to curb inflation and by new programs the president is proposing that are not fully offset by tax increases in their first year. The plan drew swift criticism from Republicans, who are locked in an economically perilous debate with Mr. Biden over the borrowing limit, which House conservatives refuse to raise unless he agrees to sharp spending cuts.
