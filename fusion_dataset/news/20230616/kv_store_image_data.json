        "description": "The image depicts a scene of destruction and desolation in a village that has been retaken during Ukraine’s counteroffensive. The setting is an abandoned building with a partially collapsed roof, exposing the sky through the damaged structure. The walls are made of brick and have large windows, some of which are broken or missing. The ground is littered with debris, including twisted metal sheets and other rubble. Three soldiers are present in the scene. One soldier is sitting on a large tire, smoking a cigarette, while another is kneeling nearby, possibly using a mobile device. The third soldier is seated on a piece of machinery or equipment, also appearing to be resting or taking a break. The overall atmosphere conveys a sense of tension and fatigue, as the soldiers take a momentary respite amidst the ruins. The background includes a fence made of corrugated metal sheets, some of which are bent and damaged, adding to the sense of destruction. The soldiers are dressed in camouflage uniforms, indicating their military role in the ongoing conflict.",

The installation consists of a dense aggregation of red, glove-like objects that appear to be made of a soft material, possibly fabric or rubber. These gloves are densely packed and form a mound that fills the lower half of the image. Interspersed among the gloves are black, thorny branches that add a contrasting texture and color to the scene. The overall atmosphere is one of intensity and perhaps unease, given the unusual combination of elements and the overwhelming presence of the gloves. The stark white walls and ceiling provide a dramatic backdrop that highlights the vivid red of the gloves and the dark, spiky branches.",
