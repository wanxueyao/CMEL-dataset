The adult peacock is characterized by a long neck and vibrant blue and green feathers, while the juveniles have brown and tan feathers. Local officials in Pinecrest are devising plans, such as peacock vasectomies, to manage the peafowl population and prevent them from breeding and running amok, as they have been causing issues like scratching roofs of homes, pecking paint off cars, and defecating on driveways.",
