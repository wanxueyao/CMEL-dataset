  <data key="d1">"The image is a black-and-white illustration depicting a scene from the story of Alice in Wonderland. On the left side, there is a character who appears to be Tweedledum, characterized by his round face, large eyes, and exaggerated expression of anger and frustration. He is wearing a hat and a coat, and his posture suggests he is in the middle of a tantrum, with one arm raised and the other clutching an object that resembles a rattle. His eyes are wide open, and his mouth is agape, indicating a state of intense emotion. To his right stands Alice, a young girl with long, curly hair, dressed in a dress with a frilly collar and striped stockings. She has a calm and composed demeanor, extending her hand towards Tweedledum in a gesture of soothing or calming him down. The background is filled with swirling lines and shapes, suggesting movement and chaos, which adds to the overall atmosphere of tension and confusion. The illustration captures a moment of conflict and misunderstanding between Alice and Tweedledum, highlighting the absurdity and whimsical nature of the scene."</data>
