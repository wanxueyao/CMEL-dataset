  <data key="d1">"The image is a black-and-white illustration depicting a scene from the story of Alice in Wonderland. In the center, Alice, a young girl with long hair, is holding a large plum cake on a platter. To her left stands an unicorn, dressed in a striped garment and wearing a crown, appearing to be in a conversation with the lion on the right. The lion, with a mane and a somewhat tired expression, is lying down with his chin resting on his paws. Behind Alice, there is a figure with rabbit-like ears, possibly the White Rabbit, holding a staff and a ball. The background includes tall grass and a few plants, suggesting an outdoor setting. The overall atmosphere is whimsical and fantastical, capturing the surreal and dreamlike quality of the story."</data>
