Have a sausage, they’re not bad cold—an’ I wouldn’ say no teh a bit o’ yer birthday cake, neither.”  \n\n“Wizards have banks?”  \n\n“Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.”  \n\nHarry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding.  \n\n“Goblins?”  \n\n“Yeah—so yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it, I’ll tell yeh that. Never mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe—’cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter ${\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{o}}}^{\\prime}$ fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts business.” Hagrid drew himself up proudly. “He usually gets me ter do important stuŀ fer him. Fetchin’ you—gettin’ things from Gringotts—knows he can trust me, see.  \n\n“Got everythin’? Come on, then.”  \n\nHarry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm.  \n\n“How did you get here?” Harry asked, looking around for another boat.  \n\n“Flew,” said Hagrid.  \n\n“Flew?”  \n\n“Yeah—but we’ll go back in this. Not s’pposed ter use magic now I’ve got yeh.”  \n\nThey settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine him łying.  \n\n“Seems a shame ter row, though,” said Hagrid, giving Harry another of his sideways looks. “If I was ter—er—speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin’ it at Hogwarts?”  \n\n“Of course not,” said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped oŀ toward land.  \n\n“Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?” Harry asked.  \n\nSpells—enchantments,”  said  Hagrid,  unfolding  his newspaper as he spoke. “They say there’s dragons guardin’ the high-security vaults. And then yeh gotta Łnd yer way— Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh’d die of hunger tryin’ ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.”  \n\nHarry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very diŃcult, he’d never had so many questions in his life.  \n\n“Ministry o’ Magic messin’ things up as usual,” Hagrid muttered, turning the page.  \n\n“There’s a Ministry of Magic?” Harry asked, before he could stop himself.  \n\n“’Course,”  said  Hagrid.  “They  wanted  Dumbledore  fer Minister, o’ course, but he’d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askin’ fer advice.”  \n\n“But what does a Ministry of Magic do?”  \n\n“Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there’s still witches an’ wizards up an’ down the country.”  \n\n“Why?”  \n\n“Why?  Blimey,  Harry,  everyone’d  be  wantin’  magic solutions to their problems. Nah, we’re best left alone.”  \n\nAt this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street.  \n\nPassersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station. Harry couldn’t blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, “See that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?”  \n\n“Hagrid,” said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, “did you say there are dragons at Gringotts?”  \n\n“Well, so they say,” said Hagrid. “Crikey, I’d like a dragon.”  \n\n“You’d like one?”  \n\n“Wanted one ever since I was a kid—here we go.”  \n\nThey had reached the station. There was a train to London in Łve minutes’ time. Hagrid, who didn’t understand “Muggle money,” as he called it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets.  \n\nPeople stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent.  \n\n“Still got yer letter, Harry?” he asked as he counted stitches.  \n\nHarry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket.  \n\n“Good,” said Hagrid. “There’s a list there of everything yeh need.”  \n\nHarry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn’t noticed the night before, and read:  \n\nHOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY  \n\nUNIFORM  \n\nFirst-year students will require:  \n\n1. Three sets of plain work robes (black)   \n2. One plain pointed hat (black) for day wear   \n3. One pair of protective gloves (dragon hide or similar)   \n4",

Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.  \n\n“I don’t know how the Muggles manage without magic,” he said as they climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops.  \n\nHagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn’t known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn’t help trusting him.  \n\n“This is it,” said Hagrid, coming to a halt, “the Leaky Cauldron. It’s a famous place.”  \n\nIt was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn’t pointed it out, Harry wouldn’t have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn’t glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn’t see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside.  \n\nFor a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, “The usual, Hagrid?”  \n\n“Can’t,  Tom,  I’m  on  Hogwarts  business,”  said  Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harry’s shoulder and making  \n\nHarry’s knees buckle.  \n\n“Good Lord,” said the bartender, peering at Harry, “is this— can this be—?”  \n\nThe Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.  \n\n“Bless  my  soul,”  whispered  the  old  bartender,  “Harry Potter...what an honor.”  \n\nHe hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes.  \n\n“Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.”  \n\nHarry didn’t know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old woman with the pipe was puŃng on it without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was beaming.  \n\nThen there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.  \n\n“Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can’t believe I’m meeting you at last.”  \n\n“So proud, Mr. Potter, I’m just so proud.”  \n\n“Always wanted to shake your hand—I’m all of a łutter.”  \n\n“Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can’t tell you, Diggle’s the name, Dedalus Diggle.”  \n\n“I’ve seen you before!” said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle’s top hat fell oŀ in his excitement. “You bowed to me once in a shop.”  \n\n“He remembers!” cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone. “Did you hear that? He remembers me!”  \n\nHarry shook hands again and again—Doris Crockford kept coming back for more.  \n\nA pale",

He remembers me!”  \n\nHarry shook hands again and again—Doris Crockford kept coming back for more.  \n\nA pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his eyes was twitching.  \n\n“Professor Quirrell!” said Hagrid. “Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.”  \n\n“P-P-Potter,”  stammered  Professor  Quirrell,  grasping Harry’s hand, “c-can’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.”  \n\n“What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?”  \n\n“D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered Professor Quirrell, as though he’d rather not think about it. “N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?” He laughed nervously. “You’ll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I’ve g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself.” He looked terriŁed at the very thought.  \n\nBut the others wouldn’t let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all.  \n\nAt last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble.  \n\n“Must get on—lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.”  \n\nDoris Crockford shook Harry’s hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.  \n\nHagrid grinned at Harry.  \n\n“Told  yeh,  didn’t  I?  Told  yeh  you  was  famous.  Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh—mind you, he’s usually tremblin’.”  \n\n“Is he always that nervous?”  \n\n“Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was Łne while he was studyin’ outta books but then he took a year oŀ ter get some Łrst-hand experience....They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o’ trouble with a hag— never been the same since. Scared of the students, scared of his own subject—now, where’s me umbrella?”  \n\nVampires? Hags? Harry’s head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can.  \n\n“Three up...two across...” he muttered. “Right, stand back, Harry.”  \n\nHe tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.  \n\nThe brick he had touched quivered—it wriggled—in the middle, a small hole appeared—it grew wider and wider—a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.  \n\n“Welcome,” said Hagrid, “to Diagon Alley.”  \n\nHe grinned at Harry’s amazement. They stepped through the archway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall.  \n\nThe sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop. Cauldrons—All Sizes—Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver —Self-Stirring—Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them.  \n\n“Yeah, you’ll be needin’ one,” said Hagrid, “but we gotta get yer money Łrst.”  \n\nHarry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, “Dragon liver, sixteen Sickles an ounce, they’re mad....”  \n\nA low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium—Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about Harry’s age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it. “Look,” Harry heard one of them say, “the new Nimbus Two Thousand —fastest ever—” There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels’ eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon....  \n\n“Gringotts,” said Hagrid.  \n\nThey had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was—  \n\n“Yeah, that’s a goblin,” said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long Łngers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them:  \n\nEnter, stranger, but take heed Of what awaits the sin of greed, For those who take, but do not earn, Must pay most dearly in their turn.

Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them:  \n\nEnter, stranger, but take heed Of what awaits the sin of greed, For those who take, but do not earn, Must pay most dearly in their turn. So if you seek beneath our floors A treasure that was never yours, Thief, you have been warned, beware Of finding more than treasure there.  \n\n“Like I said, yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it,” said Hagrid.  \n\nA pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count leading oŀ the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter.  \n\n“Morning,” said Hagrid to a free goblin. “We’ve come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter’s safe.”  \n\n“You have his key, sir?”  \n\n“Got it here somewhere,” said Hagrid, and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblin’s book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals.  \n\n“Got it,” said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.  \n\nThe goblin looked at it closely.  \n\n“That seems to be in order.”  \n\n“An’ I’ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,” said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. “It’s about the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.”  \n\nThe goblin read the letter carefully.  \n\n“Very well,” he said, handing it back to Hagrid, “I will have someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!”  \n\nGriphook  was  yet  another  goblin.  Once  Hagrid  had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading oŀ the hall.  \n\n“What’s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?” Harry asked.  \n\n“Can’t tell yeh that,” said Hagrid mysteriously. “Very secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore’s trusted me. More’n my job’s worth ter tell yeh that.”  \n\nGriphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with łaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the łoor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in—Hagrid with some diŃculty—and were oŀ.  \n\nAt Łrst they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn’t steering.  \n\nHarry’s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of Łre at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late—they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and łoor.  \n\n“I never know,” Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, “what’s the diŀerence between a stalagmite and a stalactite?”  \n\n“Stalagmite’s got an $^{\\iota}\\mathbf{m}^{\\prime}$ in it,” said Hagrid. “An’ don’ ask me questions just now, I think I’m gonna be sick.”  \n\nHe did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling.  \n\nGriphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.  \n\n“All yours,” smiled Hagrid.  \n\nAll Harry’s—it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn’t have known about this or they’d have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.  \n\nHagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.  \n\n“The gold ones are Galleons,” he explained. “Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it’s easy enough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple o’ terms, we’ll keep the rest safe for yeh.” He turned to Griphook. “Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?”  \n\n“One speed only,” said Griphook.  \n\nThey were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over",

The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruŀ of his neck.  \n\nVault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.  \n\n“Stand back,” said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with one of his long Łngers and it simply melted away.  \n\n“If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they’d be sucked through the door and trapped in there,” said Griphook.  \n\n“How often do you check to see if anyone’s inside?” Harry asked.  \n\n“About once every ten years,” said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.  \n\nSomething really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least—but at Łrst he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the łoor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask.  \n\n“Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don’t talk to me on the way back, it’s best if I keep me mouth shut,” said Hagrid.  \n\nOne wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn’t know where to run Łrst now that he had a bag full of money. He didn’t have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he’d had in his whole life—more money than even Dudley had ever had.  \n\n“Might as well get yer uniform,” said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions. “Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped oŀ fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts.” He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin’s shop alone, feeling nervous.  \n\nMadam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.  \n\n“Hogwarts, dear?” she said, when Harry started to speak. “Got the lot here—another young man being Łtted up just now, in fact.”  \n\nIn the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him, slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length.  \n\n“Hello,” said the boy, “Hogwarts, too?”  \n\n“Yes,” said Harry.  \n\n“My father’s next door buying my books and Mother’s up the street looking at wands,” said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. “Then I’m going to drag them oŀ to look at racing brooms. I don’t see why Łrst years can’t have their own. I think I’ll bully Father into getting me one and I’ll smuggle it in somehow.”  \n\nHarry was strongly reminded of Dudley.  \n\n“Have you got your own broom?” the boy went on.  \n\n“No,” said Harry.  \n\n“Play Quidditch at all?”  \n\n“No,” Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.  \n\n“I do—Father says it’s a crime if I’m not picked to play for my House, and I must say, I agree. Know what House you’ll be in yet?”  \n\n“No,” said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.  \n\n“Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I’ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been—imagine being in Huńepuŀ, I think I’d leave, wouldn’t you?”  \n\n“Mmm,” said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting.  \n\n“I say, look at that man!” said the boy suddenly, nodding toward  the  front  window.  Hagrid  was  standing  there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn’t come in.  \n\n“That’s Hagrid,” said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn’t. “He works at Hogwarts.”  \n\n“Oh,” said the boy, “I’ve heard of him. He’s a sort of servant, isn’t he?”  \n\n“He’s the gamekeeper,” said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less every second.  \n\n“Yes, exactly. I heard he’s a sort of savage—lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting Łre to his bed.”  \n\n“I think he’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly.  \n\n“Do you?” said the boy, with a slight sneer. “Why is he with you? Where are your parents?”  \n\n“They’re dead,” said Harry shortly. He didn’t feel much like going into the matter with this boy.  \n\n“Oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all. “But they were our kind, weren’t they?”  \n\n“They were a witch and wizard, if that",

He didn’t feel much like going into the matter with this boy.  \n\n“Oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all. “But they were our kind, weren’t they?”  \n\n“They were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you mean.”  \n\n“I really don’t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They’re just not the same, they’ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What’s your surname, anyway?”  \n\nBut before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, “That’s you done, my dear,” and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool.  \n\n“Well, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,” said the drawling boy.  \n\nHarry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).  \n\n“What’s up?” said Hagrid.  \n\n“Nothing,” Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, “Hagrid, what’s Quidditch?”  \n\n“Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin’ how little yeh know—not knowin’ about Quidditch!”  \n\n“Don’t make me feel worse,” said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pale boy in Madam Malkin’s.  \n\n“—and he said people from Muggle families shouldn’t even be allowed in—”  \n\n“Yer not from a Muggle family. If he’d known who yeh were— he’s grown up knowin’ yer name if his parents are wizardin’ folk. You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what does he know about it, some o’ the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in ’em in a long line o’ Muggles—look at yer mum! Look what she had fer a sister!”  \n\n“So what is Quidditch?”  \n\n“It’s our sport. Wizard sport. It’s like—like soccer in the Muggle world—everyone follows Quidditch—played up in the air on broomsticks and there’s four balls—sorta hard ter explain the rules.”  \n\n“And what are Slytherin and Huńepuŀ?”  \n\n“School Houses. There’s four. Everyone says Huńepuŀ are a lot o’ duŀers, but—”  \n\n“I bet I’m in Huńepuŀ,” said Harry gloomily.  \n\n“Better  Huńepuŀ  than  Slytherin,”  said  Hagrid  darkly. “There’s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn’t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.”  \n\n“Vol-, sorry—You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?”  \n\n“Years an’ years ago,” said Hagrid.  \n\nThey bought Harry’s school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Counter-curses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.  \n\n“I was trying to Łnd out how to curse Dudley.”  \n\n“I’m not sayin’ that’s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic  in  the  Muggle  world  except  in  very  special circumstances,” said Hagrid. “An’ anyway, yeh couldn’ work any of them curses yet, yeh’ll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level.”  \n\nHagrid wouldn’t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (“It says pewter on yer list”), but they got a nice set of scales for  weighing  potion  ingredients  and  a  collapsible  brass telescope.  Then  they  visited  the  Apothecary,  which  was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuŀ stood on the łoor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glitteryblack beetle eyes (Łve Knuts a scoop).  \n\nOutside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry’s list again.  \n\n“Just yer wand left—oh yeah, an’ I still haven’t got yeh a birthday present.”  \n\nHarry felt himself go red.  \n\n“You don’t have to—”  \n\n“I know I don’t have to.

Tell yeh what, I’ll get yer animal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh’d be laughed at —an’ I don’ like cats, they make me sneeze. I’ll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, they’re dead useful, carry yer mail an’ everythin’.”  \n\nTwenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and łickering, jewelbright eyes. Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing. He couldn’t stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell.  \n\n“Don’ mention it,” said Hagrid gruńy. “Don’ expect you’ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now—only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.”  \n\nA magic wand...this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.  \n\nThe last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window.  \n\nA tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic.  \n\n“Good afternoon,” said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly oŀ the spindly chair.  \n\nAn old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop.  \n\n“Hello,” said Harry awkwardly.  \n\n“Ah yes,” said the man. “Yes, yes. I thought I’d be seeing you soon. Harry Potter.” It wasn’t a question. “You have your mother’s eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her Łrst wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work.”  \n\nMr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy.  \n\n“Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transŁguration. Well, I say your father favored it—it’s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.”  \n\nMr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself rełected in those misty eyes.  \n\n“And that’s where...”  \n\nMr.  Ollivander  touched  the  lightning  scar  on  Harry’s forehead with a long, white Łnger.  \n\n“I’m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,” he said softly. “Thirteen-and-a-half  inches.  Yew.  Powerful  wand,  very powerful, and in the wrong hands...well, if I’d known what that wand was going out into the world to do....”  \n\nHe shook his head and then, to Harry’s relief, spotted Hagrid.  \n\n“Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again....Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn’t it?”  \n\n“It was, sir, yes,” said Hagrid.  \n\n“Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled?” said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern.  \n\n“Er—yes, they did, yes,” said Hagrid, shuńing his feet. “I’ve still got the pieces, though,” he added brightly.  \n\n“But you don’t use them?” said Mr. Ollivander sharply.  \n\n“Oh, no, sir,” said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke.  \n\n“Hmmm,” said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. “Well, now—Mr. Potter. Let me see.” He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket. “Which is your wand arm?”  \n\n“Er—well, I’m right-handed,” said Harry.  \n\n“Hold out your arm. That’s it.” He measured Harry from shoulder to Łnger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to łoor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he measured, he said, “Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard’s wand.”",

And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard’s wand.”  \n\nHarry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was łitting around the shelves, taking down boxes.  \n\n“That will do,” he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the łoor. “Right then, Mr. Potter. Try this one.  \n\nBeechwood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and łexible. Just take it and give it a wave.”  \n\nHarry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once.  \n\n“Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try—”  \n\nHarry tried—but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander.  \n\n“No, no—here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.”  \n\nHarry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become.  \n\n“Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we’ll Łnd the perfect match here somewhere—I wonder, now—yes, why not— unusual combination—holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.”  \n\nHarry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his Łngers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a Łrework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, “Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well...how curious...how very curious...”  \n\nHe put Harry’s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, “Curious...curious...”  \n\n“Sorry,” said Harry, “but what’s curious?”  \n\nMr. Ollivander Łxed Harry with his pale stare.  \n\n“I remember every wand I’ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather—just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother—why, its brother gave you that scar.”  \n\nHarry swallowed.  \n\n“Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these  things  happen.  The  wand  chooses  the  wizard, remember....I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter....After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things—terrible, yes, but great.”  \n\nHarry shivered. He wasn’t sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his shop.  \n\nThe late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn’t speak at all as they walked down the road; he didn’t even notice how much people were gawking at them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry’s lap. Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder.  \n\n“Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,” he said.  \n\nHe bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow.  \n\n“You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,” said Hagrid.  \n\nHarry wasn’t sure he could explain. He’d just had the best birthday of his life—and yet—he chewed his hamburger, trying to Łnd the words.  \n\n“Everyone thinks I’m special,” he said at last. “All those people  in  the  Leaky  Cauldron,  Professor  Quirrell,  Mr. Ollivander...but I don’t know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I’m famous and I can’t even remember what I’m famous for. I don’t know what happened when Vol-, sorry—I mean, the night my parents died.”  \n\nHagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile.  \n\n“Don’ you worry, Harry. You’ll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you’ll be just Łne. Just be yerself. I know it’s hard. Yeh’ve been singled out, an’ that’s always hard. But yeh’ll have a great time at Hogwarts—I did— still do, ’smatter of fact.”  \n\nHagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope.",

But yeh’ll have a great time at Hogwarts—I did— still do, ’smatter of fact.”  \n\nHagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope.  \n\n“Yer ticket fer Hogwarts,” he said. “First o’ September— King’s Cross—it’s all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she’ll know where to Łnd me....See yeh soon, Harry.”  \n\nThe train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.  \n\n![](images/image_1.jpg)  \n\narry’s last month with the Dursleys wasn’t fun. True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn’t stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn’t shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him—in fact, they didn’t speak to him at all. Half terriŁed, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while.  \n\nHarry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn’t come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked oŀ another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the Łrst.  \n\nOn the last day of August he thought he’d better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King’s Cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the room.  \n\n“Er—Uncle Vernon?”  \n\nUncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening.  \n\n“Er—I need to be at King’s Cross tomorrow to—to go to Hogwarts.”  \n\nUncle Vernon grunted again.  \n\n“Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?”  \n\nGrunt. Harry supposed that meant yes.  \n\n“Thank you.”  \n\nHe was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke.  \n\n“Funny way to get to a wizards’ school, the train. Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?”  \n\nHarry didn’t say anything.  \n\n“Where is this school, anyway?”  \n\n“I don’t know,” said Harry, realizing this for the Łrst time. He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket.  \n\n“I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven o’clock,” he read.  \n\nHis aunt and uncle stared.  \n\n“Platform what?”  \n\n“Nine and three-quarters.”  \n\n“Don’t talk rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon. “There is no platform nine and three-quarters.”  \n\n“It’s on my ticket.”  \n\n“Barking,” said Uncle Vernon, “howling mad, the lot of them. You’ll see. You just wait. All right, we’ll take you to King’s Cross. We’re going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn’t bother.”  \n\n“Why are you going to London?” Harry asked, trying to keep things friendly.  \n\n“Taking Dudley to the hospital,” growled Uncle Vernon. “Got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.”  \n\nHarry woke at Łve o’clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn’t want to walk into the station in his wizard’s robes—he’d change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry’s huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys’ car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set oŀ.  \n\nThey reached King’s Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry’s trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face.  \n\n“Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine—platform ten. Your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don’t seem to have built it yet, do they?”  \n\nHe was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, nothing at all.  \n\n“Have a good term,” said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of them were laughing. Harry’s mouth went rather dry. What on earth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He’d have",

He left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of them were laughing. Harry’s mouth went rather dry. What on earth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He’d have to ask someone.  \n\nHe stopped a passing guard, but didn’t dare mention platform nine and three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn’t even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o’clock, but the guard said there wasn’t one. In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic. According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.  \n\nHagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector’s stand between platforms nine and ten.  \n\nAt that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying.  \n\n“—packed with Muggles, of course—”  \n\nHarry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with łaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like Harry’s in front of him—and they had an owl.  \n\nHeart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying.  \n\n“Now, what’s the platform number?” said the boys’ mother.  \n\n“Nine and three-quarters!” piped a small girl, also redheaded, who was holding her hand. “Mum, can’t I go...”  \n\n“You’re not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, you go Łrst.”  \n\nWhat looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten. Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it—but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished.  \n\n“Fred, you next,” the plump woman said.  \n\n“I’m not Fred, I’m George,” said the boy. “Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother? Can’t you tell I’m George?”  \n\n“Sorry, George, dear.”  \n\n“Only joking, I am Fred,” said the boy, and oŀ he went. His twin called after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later, he had gone—but how had he done it?  \n\nNow the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier—he was almost there—and then, quite suddenly, he wasn’t anywhere.  \n\nThere was nothing else for it.  \n\n“Excuse me,” Harry said to the plump woman.  \n\n“Hello, dear,” she said. “First time at Hogwarts? Ron’s new, too.”  \n\nShe pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.  \n\n“Yes,” said Harry. “The thing is—the thing is, I don’t know how to—”  \n\n“How to get onto the platform?” she said kindly, and Harry nodded.  \n\n“Not to worry,” she said. “All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don’t stop and don’t be scared you’ll crash into it, that’s very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if you’re nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.”  \n\n“Er—okay,” said Harry.  \n\nHe pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very solid.  \n\nHe started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash right into that barrier and then he’d be in trouble—leaning forward on his cart, he broke into a heavy run—the barrier was coming nearer and nearer—he wouldn’t be able to stop—the cart was out of control—he was a foot away—he closed his eyes ready for the crash—  \n\nIt didn’t come...he kept on running...he opened his eyes.  \n\nA scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven o’clock. Harry looked behind him and saw a wroughtiron archway where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it. He had done it.  \n\nSmoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks.  \n\nThe Łrst few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some Łghting over seats.

Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks.  \n\nThe Łrst few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some Łghting over seats. Harry pushed his cart oŀ down the platform in search of an empty seat. He passed a round-faced boy who was saying, “Gran, I’ve lost my toad again.”  \n\n“Oh, Neville,” he heard the old woman sigh.  \n\nA boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.  \n\n“Give us a look, Lee, go on.”  \n\nThe boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg.  \n\nHarry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside Łrst and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot.  \n\n“Want a hand?” It was one of the red-haired twins he’d followed through the barrier.  \n\n“Yes, please,” Harry panted.  \n\n“Oy, Fred! C’mere and help!”  \n\nWith the twins’ help, Harry’s trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment.  \n\n“Thanks,” said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes.  \n\n“What’s that?” said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry’s lightning scar.  \n\n“Blimey,” said the other twin. “Are you—?”  \n\n“He is,” said the Łrst twin. “Aren’t you?” he added to Harry.  \n\n“What?” said Harry.  \n\n“Harry Potter,” chorused the twins.  \n\n“Oh, him,” said Harry. “I mean, yes, I am.”  \n\nThe two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red. Then, to his relief, a voice came łoating in through the train’s open door.  \n\n“Fred? George? Are you there?”  \n\n“Coming, Mum.”  \n\nWith a last look at Harry, the twins hopped oŀ the train.  \n\nHarry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying. Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief.  \n\n“Ron, you’ve got something on your nose.”  \n\nThe youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose.  \n\n“Mum—geroŀ.” He wriggled free.  \n\n“Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got someŁnk on his nosie?” said one of the twins.  \n\n“Shut up,” said Ron.  \n\n“Where’s Percy?” said their mother.  \n\n“He’s coming now.”  \n\nThe oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny red-and-gold badge on his chest with the letter P on it.  \n\n“Can’t stay long, Mother,” he said. “I’m up front, the prefects have got two compartments to themselves—”  \n\n“Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?” said one of the twins, with an air of great surprise. “You should have said something, we had no idea.”  \n\n“Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,” said the other twin. “Once—”  \n\n“Or twice—”  \n\n“A minute—”  \n\n“All summer—”  \n\n“Oh, shut up,” said Percy the Prefect.  \n\n“How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?” said one of the twins.  \n\n“Because he’s a prefect,” said their mother fondly. “All right, dear, well, have a good term—send me an owl when you get there.”  \n\nShe kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the twins.  \n\n“Now, you two—this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl telling me you’ve—you’ve blown up a toilet or —”  \n\n“Blown up a toilet? We’ve never blown up a toilet.”  \n\n“Great idea though, thanks, Mum.”  \n\n“It’s not funny. And look after Ron.”  \n\n“Don’t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.”  \n\n“Shut up,” said Ron again. He was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it.  \n\n“Hey, Mum, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?”  \n\nHarry leaned back quickly so they couldn’t see him looking.  \n\n“You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station? Know who he is?”  \n\n“Who?”  \n\n“Harry Potter!”  \n\nHarry heard the little girl’s voice.  \n\n“Oh, Mum, can I go on the train and see him, Mum, oh please....”  \n\n“You’ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn’t something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?”  \n\n“Asked him. Saw his scar. It’s really there—like lightning.”  \n\n“Poor dear—no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform.”  \n\n“Never mind that, do you think he remembers what YouKnow-Who looks like?”  \n\nTheir mother suddenly became very stern.  \n\n“I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don’t you dare. As though",

He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform.”  \n\n“Never mind that, do you think he remembers what YouKnow-Who looks like?”  \n\nTheir mother suddenly became very stern.  \n\n“I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don’t you dare. As though he needs reminding of that on his Łrst day at school.”  \n\n“All right, keep your hair on.”  \n\nA whistle sounded.  \n\n“Hurry up!” their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the train. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-bye, and their younger sister began to cry.  \n\n“Don’t, Ginny, we’ll send you loads of owls.”  \n\n“We’ll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat.”  \n\n“George!”  \n\n“Only joking, Mum.”  \n\nThe train began to move. Harry saw the boys’ mother waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved.  \n\nHarry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner. Houses łashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He didn’t know what he was going to—but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind.  \n\nThe door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in.  \n\n“Anyone sitting there?” he asked, pointing at the seat opposite Harry. “Everywhere else is full.”  \n\nHarry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn’t looked. Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose.  \n\n“Hey, Ron.”  \n\nThe twins were back.  \n\n“Listen, we’re going down the middle of the train—Lee Jordan’s got a giant tarantula down there.”  \n\n“Right,” mumbled Ron.  \n\n“Harry,” said the other twin, “did we introduce ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then.”  \n\n“Bye,” said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment door shut behind them.  \n\n“Are you really Harry Potter?” Ron blurted out.  \n\nHarry nodded.  \n\n“Oh—well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George’s jokes,” said Ron. “And have you really got—you know...”  \n\nHe pointed at Harry’s forehead.  \n\nHarry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron stared.  \n\n“So that’s where You-Know-Who—?”  \n\n“Yes,” said Harry, “but I can’t remember it.”  \n\n“Nothing?” said Ron eagerly.  \n\n“Well—I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.”  \n\n“Wow,” said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again.  \n\n“Are all your family wizards?” asked Harry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him.  \n\n“Er—yes, I think so,” said Ron. “I think Mum’s got a second cousin who’s an accountant, but we never talk about him.”  \n\n“So you must know loads of magic already.”  \n\nThe Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about.  \n\n“I heard you went to live with Muggles,” said Ron. “What are they like?”  \n\n“Horrible—well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though. Wish I’d had three wizard brothers.”  \n\n“Five,” said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. “I’m the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I’ve got a lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left—Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy’s a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they’re really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it’s no big deal, because they did it Łrst. You never get anything new, either, with Łve brothers. I’ve got Bill’s old robes, Charlie’s old wand, and Percy’s old rat.”  \n\nRon reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep.  \n\n“His name’s Scabbers and he’s useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn’t aŀ—I mean, I got Scabbers instead.”  \n\nRon’s ears went pink. He seemed to think he’d said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window.  \n\nHarry didn’t think there was anything wrong with not being able to aŀord an owl. After all, he’d never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley’s old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up.  \n\n“...and until Hagrid told me, I didn’t know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort—”  \n\nRon gasped.  \n\n“What?” said Harry.  \n\n“You said You-Know-Who’s name!” said Ron, sounding both shocked and impressed. “I’d have thought you, of all people—”  \n\n“I’m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,” said Harry, “I just never knew",

See what I mean? I’ve got loads to learn....I bet,” he added, voicing for the Łrst time something that had been worrying him a lot lately, “I bet I’m the worst in the class.”  \n\n“You won’t be. There’s loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough.”  \n\nWhile they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London. Now they were speeding past Łelds full of cows and sheep. They were quiet for a time, watching the Łelds and lanes łick past.  \n\nAround half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said, “Anything oŀ the cart, dears?”  \n\nHarry, who hadn’t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron’s ears went pink again and he muttered that he’d brought sandwiches. Harry went out into the corridor.  \n\nHe had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars Bars as he could carry—but the woman didn’t have Mars Bars. What she did have were Bertie Bott’s  Every  Flavor  Beans,  Drooble’s  Best  Blowing  Gum, Chocolate Frogs, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.  \n\nRon  stared  as  Harry  brought  it  all  back  in  to  the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat.  \n\n“Hungry, are you?”  \n\n“Starving,” said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty.  \n\nRon had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were four sandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, “She always forgets I don’t like corned beef.”  \n\n“Swap you for one of these,” said Harry, holding up a pasty. “Go on—”  \n\n“You don’t want this, it’s all dry,” said Ron. “She hasn’t got much time,” he added quickly, “you know, with Łve of us.”  \n\n“Go on, have a pasty,” said Harry, who had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through  all  Harry’s  pasties,  cakes,  and  candies  (the sandwiches lay forgotten).  \n\n“What are these?” Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs. “They’re not really frogs, are they?” He was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him.  \n\n“No,” said Ron. “But see what the card is. I’m missing Agrippa.”  \n\n“What?”  \n\n“Oh, of course, you wouldn’t know—Chocolate Frogs have cards inside them, you know, to collect—famous witches and wizards. I’ve got about Łve hundred, but I haven’t got Agrippa or Ptolemy.”  \n\nHarry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a man’s face. He wore half-moon glasses, had a long,  crooked  nose,  and  łowing  silver  hair,  beard,  and mustache. Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore.  \n\n“So this is Dumbledore!” said Harry.  \n\n“Don’t tell me you’d never heard of Dumbledore!” said Ron. “Can I have a frog? I might get Agrippa—thanks—”  \n\nHarry turned over his card and read:  \n\nALBUS DUMBLEDORE CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in $\\mathbf{I945}$ , for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling.  \n\nHarry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore’s face had disappeared.  \n\n“He’s gone!”  \n\n“Well, you can’t expect him to hang around all day,” said Ron. “He’ll be back. No, I’ve got Morgana again and I’ve got about six of her...do you want it? You can start collecting.”  \n\nRon’s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped.  \n\n“Help yourself,” said Harry. “But in, you know, the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos.”  \n\n“Do they? What, they don’t move at all?” Ron sounded amazed. “Weird!”  \n\nHarry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn’t keep his eyes oŀ them. Soon he had not only",

Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn’t keep his eyes oŀ them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He Łnally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans.  \n\n“You want to be careful with those,” Ron warned Harry. “When they say every łavor, they mean every łavor—you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger-łavored one once.”  \n\nRon picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner.  \n\n“Bleaaargh—see? Sprouts.”  \n\nThey had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coŀee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end oŀ a funny gray one Ron wouldn’t touch, which turned out to be pepper.  \n\nThe countryside now łying past the window was becoming wilder. The neat Łelds had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills.  \n\nThere was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and three-quarters came in. He looked tearful.  \n\n“Sorry,” he said, “but have you seen a toad at all?”  \n\nWhen they shook their heads, he wailed, “I’ve lost him! He keeps getting away from me!”  \n\n“He’ll turn up,” said Harry.  \n\n“Yes,” said the boy miserably. “Well, if you see him...”  \n\nHe left.  \n\n“Don’t know why he’s so bothered,” said Ron. “If I’d brought a toad I’d lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can’t talk.”  \n\nThe rat was still snoozing on Ron’s lap.  \n\n“He might have died and you wouldn’t know the diŀerence,” said Ron in disgust. “I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but the spell didn’t work. I’ll show you, look...”  \n\nHe rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking  wand.  It  was  chipped  in  places  and something white was glinting at the end.  \n\n“Unicorn hair’s nearly poking out. Anyway—”  \n\nHe had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again. The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes.  \n\n“Has anyone seen a toad? Neville’s lost one,” she said. She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth.  \n\n“We’ve already told him we haven’t seen it,” said Ron, but the girl wasn’t listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand.  \n\n“Oh, are you doing magic? Let’s see it, then.”  \n\nShe sat down. Ron looked taken aback.  \n\n“Er—all right.”  \n\nHe cleared his throat.  \n\n“Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.”  \n\nHe waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep.  \n\n“Are you sure that’s a real spell?” said the girl. “Well, it’s not very good, is it? I’ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it’s all worked for me. Nobody in my family’s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it’s the very best school of witchcraft there is, I’ve heard—I’ve learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough—I’m Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?”  \n\nShe said all this very fast.  \n\nHarry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn’t learned all the course books by heart either.  \n\n“I’m Ron Weasley,” Ron muttered.  \n\n“Harry Potter,” said Harry.  \n\n“Are you really?” said Hermione. “I know all about you, of course—I got a few extra books for background reading, and you’re in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark  Arts  and  Great  Wizarding  Events  of  the  Twentieth Century.”  \n\n“Am I?” said Harry, feeling dazed.  \n\n“Goodness, didn’t you know, I’d have found out everything I could if it was me,” said Hermione. “Do either of you know what House you’ll be in? I’ve been asking around, and I hope I’m in GryŃndor, it sounds by far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t be too bad....Anyway, we’d better go and look for Neville’s toad.

He threw his wand back into his trunk. “Stupid spell—George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud.”  \n\n“What House are your brothers in?” asked Harry.  \n\n“GryŃndor,” said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. “Mum and Dad were in it, too. I don’t know what they’ll say if I’m not. I don’t suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.”  \n\n“That’s the House Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?”  \n\n“Yeah,” said Ron. He łopped back into his seat, looking depressed.  \n\n“You know, I think the ends of Scabbers’ whiskers are a bit lighter,” said Harry, trying to take Ron’s mind oŀ Houses. “So what  do  your  oldest  brothers  do  now  that  they’ve  left, anyway?”  \n\nHarry was wondering what a wizard did once he’d Łnished school.  \n\n“Charlie’s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill’s in Africa doing something for Gringotts,” said Ron. “Did you hear about Gringotts? It’s been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don’t suppose you get that with the Muggles—someone tried to rob a high security vault.”  \n\nHarry stared.  \n\n“Really? What happened to them?”  \n\n“Nothing, that’s why it’s such big news. They haven’t been caught. My dad says it must’ve been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they don’t think they took anything, that’s  what’s  odd.  ’Course,  everyone  gets  scared  when something like this happens in case You-Know-Who’s behind it.”  \n\nHarry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get  a  prickle  of  fear  every  time  You-Know-Who  was mentioned. He supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying “Voldemort” without worrying.  \n\n“What’s your Quidditch team?” Ron asked.  \n\n“Er—I don’t know any,” Harry confessed.  \n\n“What!” Ron looked dumbfounded. “Oh, you wait, it’s the best game in the world—” And he was oŀ, explaining all about the  four  balls  and  the  positions  of  the  seven  players, describing famous games he’d been to with his brothers and the broomstick he’d like to get if he had the money. He was just taking Harry through the Łner points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn’t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time.  \n\nThree boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: It was the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s robe shop. He was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than he’d shown back in Diagon Alley.  \n\n“Is it true?” he said. “They’re saying all down the train that Harry Potter’s in this compartment. So it’s you, is it?”  \n\n“Yes,” said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards.  \n\n“Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,” said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking. “And my name’s Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.”  \n\nRon gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger. Draco Malfoy looked at him.  \n\n“Think my name’s funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can aŀord.”  \n\nHe turned back to Harry. “You’ll soon Łnd out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don’t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.”  \n\nHe held out his hand to shake Harry’s, but Harry didn’t take it.  \n\n“I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,” he said coolly.  \n\nDraco Malfoy didn’t go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks.  \n\n“I’d be careful if I were you, Potter,” he said slowly. “Unless you’re a bit politer you’ll go the same way as your parents. They didn’t know what was good for them, either. You hang around with riŀraŀ like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it’ll rub oŀ on you.”  \n\nBoth Harry and Ron stood up.  \n\n“Say that again,” Ron said, his face as red as his hair.  \n\n“Oh, you’re going to Łght us, are you?” Malfoy sneered.  \n\n“Unless you get out now,” said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because Crabbe",

We’ve eaten all our food and you still seem to have some.”  \n\nGoyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron— Ron leapt forward, but before he’d so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell.  \n\nScabbers the rat was hanging oŀ his Łnger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle’s knuckle—Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbers Łnally łew oŀ and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they’d heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.  \n\n“What has been going on?” she said, looking at the sweets all over the łoor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail.  \n\n“I think he’s been knocked out,” Ron said to Harry. He looked closer at Scabbers. “No—I don’t believe it—he’s gone back to sleep.”  \n\nAnd so he had.  \n\n“You’ve met Malfoy before?”  \n\nHarry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley.  \n\n“I’ve heard of his family,” said Ron darkly. “They were some of the Łrst to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they’d been bewitched. My dad doesn’t believe it. He says Malfoy’s father didn’t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.” He turned to Hermione. “Can we help you with something?”  \n\n“You’d better hurry up and put your robes on, I’ve just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he says we’re nearly there. You haven’t been Łghting, have you? You’ll be in trouble before we even get there!”  \n\n“Scabbers has been Łghting, not us,” said Ron, scowling at her. “Would you mind leaving while we change?”  \n\n“All right—I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors,” said Hermione in a sniŀy voice. “And you’ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?”  \n\nRon glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It was getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky. The train did seem to be slowing down.  \n\nHe and Ron took oŀ their jackets and pulled on their long black robes. Ron’s were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them.  \n\nA voice echoed through the train: “We will be reaching Hogwarts in Łve minutes’ time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately.”  \n\nHarry’s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under his freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor.  \n\nThe train slowed right down and Łnally stopped. People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: “Firs’ years! Firs’ years over here! All right there, Harry?”  \n\nHagrid’s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.  \n\n“C’mon, follow me—any more Łrs’ years? Mind yer step, now! Firs’ years follow me!”  \n\nSlipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniŀed once or twice.  \n\n“Yeh’ll get yer Łrs’ sight o’ Hogwarts in a sec,” Hagrid called over his shoulder, “jus’ round this bend here.”  \n\nThere was a loud “Oooooh!”  \n\nThe narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.  \n\n“No more’n four to a boat!” Hagrid called, pointing to a łeet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione.  \n\n“Everyone in?” shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself. “Right then—FORWARD!”  \n\nAnd the łeet of little boats moved oŀ all at once, gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliŀ on which it stood.  \n\n“Heads down!” yelled Hagrid as the Łrst boats reached the cliŀ; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a",

It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliŀ on which it stood.  \n\n“Heads down!” yelled Hagrid as the Łrst boats reached the cliŀ; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliŀ face. They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles.  \n\n“Oy, you there! Is this your toad?” said Hagrid, who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them.  \n\n“Trevor!” cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid’s lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.  \n\nThey walked up a łight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, oak front door.  \n\n“Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?”  \n\nHagrid raised a gigantic Łst and knocked three times on the castle door.  \n\n![](images/image_2.jpg)  \n\nT  \n\nhe door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry’s Łrst thought was that this was not someone to cross.  \n\n“The Łrs’ years, Professor McGonagall,” said Hagrid. “Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.”  \n\nShe pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have Łt the whole of the Dursleys’ house in it. The stone walls were lit with łaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magniŁcent marble staircase facing them led to the upper łoors.  \n\nThey followed Professor McGonagall across the łagged stone łoor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right—the rest of the school must already be here—but Professor McGonagall showed the Łrst years into a small, empty chamber oŀ the hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously.  \n\n“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House common room.  \n\n“The  four  Houses  are  called  GryŃndor,  Huńepuŀ, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points. At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House Cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House becomes yours.  \n\n“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.”  \n\nHer eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to łatten his hair.  \n\n“I shall return when we are ready for you,” said Professor McGonagall. “Please wait quietly.”  \n\nShe left the chamber. Harry swallowed.  \n\n“How exactly do they sort us into Houses?” he asked Ron.  \n\n“Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking.”  \n\nHarry’s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole school? But he didn’t know any magic yet—what on earth would he have to do? He hadn’t expected something like this the moment they arrived. He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terriŁed, too. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she’d learned and wondering which one she’d need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her.  \n\nHe’d never been more nervous, never, not even when he’d had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he’d somehow turned his teacher’s wig blue. He kept his eyes Łxed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom.  \n\nThen something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air—several people behind him screamed.  \n\n“What the—?”  \n\nHe gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the Łrst years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was saying: “Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance—”  \n\n“My dear Friar, haven’t we given Peeves all the chances he deserves?

Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the Łrst years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was saying: “Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance—”  \n\n“My dear Friar, haven’t we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he’s not really even a ghost—I say, what are you all doing here?”  \n\nA ghost wearing a ruŀ and tights had suddenly noticed the Łrst years.  \n\nNobody answered.  \n\n“New students!” said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. “About to be Sorted, I suppose?”  \n\nA few people nodded mutely.  \n\n“Hope to see you in Huńepuŀ!” said the Friar. “My old House, you know.”  \n\n“Move  along  now,”  said  a  sharp  voice.  “The  Sorting Ceremony’s about to start.”  \n\nProfessor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts łoated away through the opposite wall.  \n\n“Now, form a line,” Professor McGonagall told the Łrst years, “and follow me.”  \n\nFeeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.  \n\nHarry  had  never  even  imagined  such  a  strange  and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were łoating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the Łrst years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the łickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione whisper, “It’s bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts: A History.”  \n\nIt was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn’t simply open on to the heavens.  \n\nHarry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the Łrst years. On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard’s hat. This hat was patched  and  frayed  and  extremely  dirty.  Aunt  Petunia wouldn’t have let it in the house.  \n\nMaybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing—noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth— and the hat began to sing:  \n\n“Oh, you may not think I’m pretty, But don’t judge on what you see, I’ll eat myself if you can find A smarter hat than me.  \n\nYou can keep your bowlers black,   \nYour top hats sleek and tall,   \nFor I’m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat And I can cap them all.   \nThere’s nothing hidden in your head The Sorting Hat can’t see,   \nSo try me on and I will tell you   \nWhere you ought to be.   \nYou might belong in Gryffindor,   \nWhere dwell the brave at heart,   \nTheir daring, nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart;   \nYou might belong in Hufflepuff, Where they are just and loyal,   \nThose patient Hufflepuffs are true And unafraid of toil;   \nOr yet in wise old Ravenclaw,   \nIf you’ve a ready mind,   \nWhere those of wit and learning, Will always find their kind;   \nOr perhaps in Slytherin   \nYou’ll make your real friends,   \nThose cunning folk use any means  \n\nTo achieve their ends.  \n\nSo put me on! Don’t be afraid!  \n\nAnd don’t get in a flap!  \n\nYou’re in safe hands (though I have none)  \n\nFor I’m a Thinking Cap!”  \n\nThe whole hall burst into applause as the hat Łnished its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.  \n\n“So we’ve just got to try on the hat!” Ron whispered to Harry. “I’ll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.”  \n\nHarry smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn’t feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a House for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him.  \n\nProfessor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment.  \n\n“When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,” she said. “Abbott, Hannah!”  \n\nA pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat",

A moment’s pause—  \n\n“HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat.  \n\nThe table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Huńepuŀ table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her.  \n\n“Bones, Susan!”  \n\n“HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled oŀ to sit next to Hannah.  \n\n“Boot, Terry!”  \n\n“RAVENCLAW!”  \n\nThe table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.  \n\n“Brocklehurst, Mandy” went to Ravenclaw too, but “Brown, Lavender” became the Łrst new GryŃndor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron’s twin brothers catcalling.  \n\n“Bulstrode, Millicent” then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry’s imagination, after all he’d heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot.  \n\nHe was starting to feel deŁnitely sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him.  \n\n“Finch-Fletchley, Justin!”  \n\n“HUFFLEPUFF!”  \n\nSometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the House at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. “Finnigan, Seamus,” the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a GryŃndor.  \n\n“Granger, Hermione!”  \n\nHermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.  \n\n“GRYFFINDOR!” shouted the hat. Ron groaned.  \n\nA horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you’re very nervous. What if he wasn’t chosen at all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it oŀ his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he’d better get back on the train?  \n\nWhen Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When it Łnally shouted, “GRYFFINDOR,” Neville ran oŀ still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to “MacDougal, Morag.”  \n\nMalfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, “SLYTHERIN!”  \n\nMalfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself.  \n\nThere weren’t many people left now.  \n\n“Moon”..., “Nott”..., “Parkinson”..., then a pair of twin girls, “Patil” and “Patil”..., then “Perks, Sally-Anne”..., and then, at last  \n\n“Potter, Harry!”  \n\nAs Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing Łres all over the hall.  \n\n“Potter, did she say?”  \n\n“The Harry Potter?”  \n\nThe last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited.  \n\n“Hmm,” said a small voice in his ear. “DiŃcult. Very diŃcult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either.  \n\nThere’s talent, oh my goodness, yes—and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that’s interesting....So where shall I put you?”  \n\nHarry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.  \n\n“Not Slytherin, eh?” said the small voice. “Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that—no? Well, if you’re sure—better be GRYFFINDOR!”  \n\nHarry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took oŀ the hat and walked shakily toward the GryŃndor table. He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, “We got Potter! We got Potter!” Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruŀ he’d seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he’d just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water.  \n\nHe could see the High Table properly now.

The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he’d just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water.  \n\nHe could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he’d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore’s silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban.  \n\nAnd now there were only three people left to be sorted. “Turpin, Lisa,” became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron’s turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his Łngers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, “GRYFFINDOR!”  \n\nHarry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him.  \n\n“Well done, Ron, excellent,” said Percy Weasley pompously across  Harry  as  “Zabini,  Blaise,”  was  made  a  Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.  \n\nHarry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.  \n\nAlbus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there.  \n\n“Welcome!” he said. “Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!  \n\n“Thank you!”  \n\nHe sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn’t know whether to laugh or not.  \n\n“Is he—a bit mad?” he asked Percy uncertainly.  \n\n“Mad?” said Percy airily. “He’s a genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?”  \n\nHarry’s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.  \n\nThe Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he’d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if it made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious.  \n\n“That does look good,” said the ghost in the ruŀ sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak.  \n\n“Can’t you—?”  \n\n“I haven’t eaten for nearly Łve hundred years,” said the ghost. “I don’t need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don’t think  I’ve  introduced  myself?  Sir  Nicholas  de  MimsyPorpington at your service. Resident ghost of GryŃndor Tower.”  \n\n“I know who you are!” said Ron suddenly. “My brothers told me about you—you’re Nearly Headless Nick!”  \n\n“I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy—” the ghost  began  stińy,  but  sandy-haired  Seamus  Finnigan interrupted.  \n\n“Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?”  \n\nSir Nicholas looked extremely miŀed, as if their little chat wasn’t going at all the way he wanted.  \n\n“Like this,” he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole head swung oŀ his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick łipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, “So—new GryŃndors! I hope you’re going to help us win the House Championship this year? GryŃndors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the Cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron’s  becoming  almost  unbearable—he’s  the  Slytherin ghost.”  \n\nHarry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn’t look too pleased with the seating arrangements.  \n\n“How did he get covered in blood?” asked Seamus with great interest.  \n\n“I’ve never asked,” said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.  \n\nWhen everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before.

A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every łavor you could think of,  apple  pies,  treacle  tarts,  chocolate  éclairs  and  jam doughnuts, triłe, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding...  \n\nAs Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families.  \n\n“I’m half-and-half,” said Seamus. “Me dad’s a Muggle. Mum didn’t tell him she was a witch ’til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.”  \n\nThe others laughed.  \n\n“What about you, Neville?” said Ron.  \n\n“Well, my gran brought me up and she’s a witch,” said Neville, “but the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me oŀ my guard and force some magic out of me—he pushed me oŀ the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned—but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid oŀered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced—all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here—they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.”  \n\nOn Harry’s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (“I do hope they start right away, there’s so  much  to  learn,  I’m  particularly  interested  in TransŁguration,  you  know,  turning  something  into something else, of course, it’s supposed to be very diŃcult—”; “You’ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing—”).  \n\nHarry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet.  Professor  McGonagall  was  talking  to  Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.  \n\nIt happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell’s turban straight into Harry’s eyes—and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry’s forehead.  \n\n“Ouch!” Harry clapped a hand to his head.  \n\n“What is it?” asked Percy.  \n\n“N-nothing.”  \n\nThe pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake oŀ was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher’s look—a feeling that he didn’t like Harry at all.  \n\n“Who’s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?” he asked Percy.  \n\n“Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he’s looking  so  nervous,  that’s  Professor  Snape.  He  teaches Potions, but he doesn’t want to—everyone knows he’s after Quirrell’s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.”  \n\nHarry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn’t look at him again.  \n\nAt  last,  the  desserts  too  disappeared,  and  Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent.  \n\n“Ahem—just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you.  \n\n“First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.”  \n\nDumbledore’s twinkling eyes łashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.  \n\n“I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.  \n\n“Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their House teams should contact Madam Hooch.  \n\n“And Łnally, I must tell you that this year, the third-łoor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.”  \n\nHarry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.  \n\n“He’s not serious?” he muttered to Percy.  \n\n“Must be,” said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. “It’s odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we’re not allowed to go somewhere—the forest’s full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have told us prefects, at least.”  \n\n“And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!” cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers’ smiles had become rather Łxed.  \n\nDumbledore gave his wand a little łick, as if he was trying to get a ły oŀ the end, and a long golden ribbon łew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.  \n\n“Everyone pick their favorite tune,” said Dumbledore, “and",

At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had Łnished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.  \n\n“Ah, music,” he said, wiping his eyes. “A magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Oŀ you trot!”  \n\nThe GryŃndor Łrst years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry’s legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt.  \n\nA bundle of walking sticks was łoating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him.  \n\n“Peeves,” Percy whispered to the Łrst years. “A poltergeist.” He raised his voice, “Peeves—show yourself.”",
