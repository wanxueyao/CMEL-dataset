First Challenge Is How to Do It.  \n\nBE’ERI, Israel — Israel Ziv, a retired Israeli Army general, was taking a bike ride Saturday morning when a flood of alarming calls started coming in.  \n\nA huge barrage of rockets had been fired from Gaza. Gunmen from Hamas, the armed Palestinian group that controls the territory, were pouring across the border. Soon he would learn a friend’s son was trapped in a kibbutz.  \n\nHe raced home, put on his uniform and grabbed his weapon, a nine-millimeter pistol.

As he neared the Gaza border, columns of black smoke rose in front of him, and the Israeli Army, at least at first, was nowhere to be seen. Hamas attackers were running across the landscape,  hunched  under  the weight of heavy machine guns and  rocket-propelled  grenade launchers, shooting at him. 11 221 Said  \n\nMr. Ziv, stocky, spiky-haired, a bit irascible, and the former head of the operations directorate of the Israel Defense Forces, is a wellknown figure in Israel, especially now. His actions over the weekend — driving headlong into the battle zone armed only with a pistol, organizing a confused group of soldiers into a fighting unit and overseeing evacuations — have been Continued on Page A9  \n\n# By STEVEN ERLANGER and RONEN BERGMAN  \n\nJERUSALEM — Israel, already bombing intensively in Gaza, is gearing up for a major military operation there unlike any in the past, warning the world that for Israel, after the massacre of its citizens by Hamas on Saturday, the rules have changed.  \n\nmarked by death,” Prime Minister Benjamin  Netanyahu  said Wednesday night, reflecting the government’s aggressive new vocabulary. On Thursday, standing with the U.S. secretary of state, Antony J. Blinken, he compared Hamas to the Islamic State and said: “Hamas is ISIS, and just as ISIS was crushed, so too will Hamas be crushed.”  \n\nThere is no disagreement in the new  unity  government,  which must approve the military’s plans, on the need to dismantle Hamas — to ensure that it can never threaten Israel again and that those responsible for the killing of more than 1,200 Israeli civilians are hunted down, officials say. That a major operation is com  \n\n# Seeking Permanent End to Threat, but Not a Reoccupation  \n\nnear the bo there are mas sive, overt Israeli troop and tank deployments, and the country has called up 360,000 reservists.   \nBut  there  are  tactical  arguments over how any operation should start, whether it will begin massively or with raiding parties, how best to coordinate Israel’s overwhelming strength in land, sea and especially air power, said Yaakov Amidror, a retired major general who served as national security adviser to Mr. Netanyahu in an earlier government and has spoken to government officials. Any invasion of Gaza, a small, densely populated territory of 2 million people, would be daunting.

Health officials in Gaza, home to two million people, said the  Israeli  bombardment  had killed more than 1,500 people and injured over 6,600 others.  \n\nIsrael’s military says that it is hitting places used by Hamas, which controls Gaza, including mosques, houses and other outwardly civilian locations. Gazans say the airstrikes are doing indiscriminate damage to civilians and civilian sites, and independent observers  have  confirmed  that schools  and  ambulances  have been destroyed.  \n\nThe retaliatory strikes began after  Hamas  terrorists  broke through the border fence with Israel on Saturday morning and attacked towns, kibbutzim and a military base, killing more than 1,200 people, most of them civilians, wounding about 3,000 others and kidnapping about 150 hostages,  the  Israeli  government said.  \n\nGaza’s  only  power  plant stopped generating electricity on Wednesday for lack of fuel, shutting down everything from lights to refrigerators, and much of the region lacks running water.

Feuds  \n\n# By LUKE BROADWATER  \n\nWASHINGTON — Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana withdrew on Thursday from consideration for the speakership he was on the cusp of claiming after hard-line Republicans balked at rallying around their party’s chosen candidate, leaving the House leaderless and the G.O.P. in chaos. After  being  narrowly  nominated  for  speaker  during  a Wednesday  closed-door  secretballot contest among House Republicans, Mr. Scalise, their No. 2 leader, found himself far from the 217 votes needed to be elected on the House floor. Many supporters of his challenger, Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the right-wing Republican endorsed by former President Donald J. Trump, refused to switch their allegiance. With no clear end in sight to the G.O.P. infighting that has left one chamber of Congress paralyzed at a time of challenges at home and Continued on Page A20  \n\n# Politics Made Them Feel Unsafe, So They Moved  \n\n# By TRIP GABRIEL  \n\nSteve Huckins, a native of Oregon,  was  preparing  to  move across the country when he went on Facebook to post a goodbye letter of sorts to his home state. “I had planned to die here,” Mr. Huckins, 59, wrote. “It’s a beautiful  state.  The  mountains,  the lakes, the rivers, the beaches. All are overshadowed by the societal and political climate.”  \n\nMr. Huckins and his wife, Ginger, were leaving Portland, Ore., one of the most progressive cities in the United States. They said Portland’s tolerance of homeless encampments,  along  with  the open use of hard drugs and rising crime, had filled them with despair. So they headed 2,000 miles east, to deep-red rural Missouri. Driving  around  their  new hometown in June, about an hour outside St. Louis, they admired the old Victorians and a tractor defying the minimum speed limit on a state road.  \n\n“One thing I do like about Missouri, there’s lots of American flags,” Mr. Huckins said as he steered  around  a  traffic  circle where  the  Stars  and  Stripes flapped crisply on a pole. “In Port  \n\nOne day earlier, in a neighboring state, another couple making a politically motivated move had a different flag on display — a Pride flag on a T-shirt.

EDWARD MORENO  \n\nWhen  Sam  Bankman-Fried’s cryptocurrency  exchange  collapsed in November, one of his oldest friends sent him a message of support.  \n\n“I love you, Sam,” said Adam Yedidia, a college classmate of Mr. Bankman-Fried’s who went on to work for him at the exchange, FTX. “I am not going anywhere. Don’t worry.”  \n\nWithin days, Mr. Yedidia had resigned from FTX. And last week, at Mr. Bankman-Fried’s fraud trial in federal court in Manhattan, Mr. Yedidia showed up to testify for the prosecution, and recounted the conversation to the jury. Mr. Bankman-Fried’s trial has offered a vivid window into one of the most dramatic corporate collapses in recent history, a \\$10 billion implosion that touched the worlds  of  Washington  politics, Wall Street finance and Silicon Valley investing. But the case also has a deeply personal undercurrent: the rapid unraveling of a close social group that has ended FTX Chief’s Fraud Trial Reveals a Dissolving of His Inner Circle  \n\nup pitting friend against friend.
