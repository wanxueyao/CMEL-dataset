True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn’t stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn’t shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him—in fact, they didn’t speak to him at all. Half terriŁed, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while. Hogwarts—I did— still do, ’smatter of fact.” Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope. “Yer ticket fer Hogwarts,” he said. “First o’ September— King’s Cross—it’s all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she’ll know where to Łnd me....See yeh soon, Harry.” The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone. ",

The stone walls were lit with łaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magniŁcent marble staircase facing “The Łrs’ years, Professor McGonagall,” said Hagrid. “Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.” he door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry’s Łrst thought was that this was not someone to cross. T where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles. “Oy, you there! Is this your toad?” said Hagrid, who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them. “Trevor!” cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid’s lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle. They walked up a łight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, oak front door. “Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?” Hagrid raised a gigantic Łst and knocked three times on the castle door. ",
