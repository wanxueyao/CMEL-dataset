  <data key="d1">"The image is a black-and-white illustration depicting a scene from a story. It shows a small, plump king wearing a crown and holding a scepter. The king appears to be in distress or surprise, with his mouth wide open and eyes bulging. He is being held up by a large hand that seems to belong to an unseen person. The king's body is wrapped in bandages, suggesting he has been injured or is being treated. The background is minimalistic, with no additional details, focusing the viewer's attention on the interaction between the hand and the king. The overall atmosphere conveyed is one of surprise and perhaps a touch of humor, as the king's exaggerated expression adds a comedic element to the scene."</data>
