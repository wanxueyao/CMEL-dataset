  <data key="d1">"The image is a black-and-white illustration depicting a scene from the story of Alice in Wonderland. It shows Alice, a young girl with long hair, holding a flamingo under her arm as if it were a croquet mallet. The flamingo's neck is extended, and its head is turned towards Alice, who appears to be blowing on it or speaking to it. Alice is dressed in a dress with puffed sleeves and a full skirt, typical of the Victorian era. At her feet, there is a hedgehog, which is depicted as a live croquet ball. The background suggests an outdoor setting with a grassy ground that has ridges and furrows, contributing to the whimsical and surreal atmosphere of the scene. The overall mood conveyed by the image is one of curiosity and wonder, as Alice interacts with these fantastical creatures in a playful yet peculiar manner."</data>
