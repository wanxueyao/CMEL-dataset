  <data key="d1">"The image is a black-and-white illustration of the Mad Hatter from Lewis Carroll's 'Alice in Wonderland.' The Mad Hatter is depicted wearing a large, tall top hat with the label 'In this style 10/6' written on it. He is dressed in a checkered outfit consisting of a jacket, vest, and pants, all featuring a pattern of squares. The Mad Hatter has a peculiar posture, with his body slightly bent forward and his head turned to the side, giving him a whimsical and eccentric appearance. His face is partially obscured by the brim of his hat, adding to his mysterious and chaotic demeanor. He is holding a piece of bread in one hand, which he appears to be examining closely. The background is minimalistic, with simple lines suggesting a ground or floor, and there are no other objects or characters present. The overall atmosphere conveyed by the image is one of absurdity and madness, fitting the character's reputation in the story."</data>
