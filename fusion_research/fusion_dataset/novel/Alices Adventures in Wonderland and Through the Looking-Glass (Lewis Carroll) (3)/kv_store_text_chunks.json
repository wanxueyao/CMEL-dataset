He looked at Alice and tried to speak, but, for a minute or two, sobs choked his voice. ‘Same as if he had a bone in his throat,’ said the Gryphon; and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on again:––  \n\n‘You may not have lived much under the sea––’ (‘I haven’t,’ said Alice)––‘and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster––’ (Alice began to say ‘I once tasted— ’ but checked herself hastily, and said ‘No, never’) —so you can  have  no  idea  what  a  delightful  thing  a  LobsterQuadrille\\* is!’  \n\n‘No, indeed,’ said Alice. ‘What sort of a dance is it?’  \n\n‘Why,’ said the Gryphon, ‘you first form into a line along the sea-shore—  \n\n‘Two lines!’ cried the Mock Turtle. ‘Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on: then, when you’ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way—  \n\n‘That generally takes some time,’ interrupted the Gryphon. ‘––you advance twice—  \n\n‘Each with a lobster as a partner!’ cried the Gryphon.  \n\n‘Of course,’ the Mock Turtle said: ‘advance twice, set to partners—  \n\n‘––change lobsters, and retire in same order,’ continued the Gryphon.  \n\n‘Then, you know,’ the Mock Turtle went on, ‘you throw the—  \n\n‘The lobsters!’ shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.  \n\n‘––as far out to sea as you can— ‘Swim after them!’ screamed the Gryphon.  \n\n‘Turn a somersault in the sea!’ cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly about.  \n\n‘Change lobsters again!’ yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.  \n\n‘Back to land again, and––that’s all the first figure,’ said the Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.  \n\n‘It must be a very pretty dance,’ said Alice timidly.   \n‘Would you like to see a little of it?’ said the Mock Turtle.  \n\n‘Very much indeed,’ said Alice.  \n\n‘Come, let’s try the first figure!’ said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon. ‘We can do it without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?’  \n\n![](images/image_1.jpg)  \n\n‘Oh, you sing,’ said the Gryphon. ‘I’ve forgotten the words.’ So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their fore-paws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly and sadly:––\\*  \n\n‘Will you walk a little faster?’\\* said a whiting to a snail, ‘There’s a porpoise close behind us, and he’s treading on my tail. See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!  \n\nThey are waiting on the shingle––will you come and join the dance? Will you, wo’n’t you, will you, wo’n’t you, will you join the dance? Will you, wo’n’t you, will you, wo’n’t you, wo’n’t you join the dance?   \n‘You can really have no notion how delightful it will be   \nWhen they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea $\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\",

Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance. Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.   \n‘What matters it how far we go?’ his scaly friend replied.   \n‘There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.   \nThe further off from England the nearer is to France––   \nThen turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance. Will you, wo’n’t you, will you, wo’n’t you, will you join the dance? Will you, wo’n’t you, will you, wo’n’t you, wo’n’t you join the dance?’  \n\n‘Thank you, it’s a very interesting dance to watch,’ said Alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last: ‘and I do so like that curious song about the whiting!’  \n\n‘Oh, as to the whiting,’ said the Mock Turtle, ‘they––you’ve seen them, of course?’ ‘Yes,’ said Alice, ‘I’ve often seen them at dinn —’ she checked herself hastily. ‘I don’t know where Dinn may be,’ said the Mock Turtle; ‘but, if you’ve seen them so often, of course you know what they’re like?’  \n\n‘I believe so,’ Alice replied thoughtfully. ‘They have their tails in their mouths\\*––and they’re all over crumbs.’  \n\n‘You’re wrong about the crumbs,’ said the Mock Turtle: ‘crumbs would all wash off in the sea. But they have their tails in their mouths; and the reason is––’ here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes. ‘Tell her about the reason and all that,’ he said to the Gryphon.  \n\n‘The reason is,’ said the Gryphon, ‘that they would go with the lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn’t get them out again. That’s all.’  \n\n‘Thank you,’ said Alice, ‘it’s very interesting. I never knew so much about a whiting before.’ ‘I can tell you more than that, if you like,’ said the Gryphon. ‘Do you know why it’s called a whiting? ‘I never thought about it,’ said Alice. ‘Why? ‘It does the boots and shoes,’ the Gryphon replied very solemnly. Alice was thoroughly puzzled. ‘Does the boots and shoes!’ she repeated in a wondering tone. ‘Why, what are your shoes done with?’ said the Gryphon. ‘I mean, what makes them so shiny?’ Alice  looked  down  at  them,  and  considered  a  little before she gave her answer. ‘They’re done with blacking, I believe.’ ‘Boots and shoes under the sea,’ the Gryphon went on in a deep voice, ‘are done with whiting. Now you know.’ ‘And what are they made of?’ Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.  \n\n‘Soles and eels, of course,’ the Gryphon replied, rather impatiently: ‘any shrimp could have told you that.’  \n\n‘If I’d been the whiting,’ said Alice, whose thoughts were still running on the song, ‘I’d have said to the porpoise “Keep back, please! We don’t want you with us!”’  \n\n‘They were obliged to have him with them,’ the Mock Turtle  said.  ‘No  wise  fish  would  go  anywhere  without a porpoise.’  \n\n‘Wouldn’t it, really?’ said Alice, in a tone of great surprise.  \n\n‘Of course not,’ said the Mock Turtle. ‘Why, if a fish came to me, and told me he was going a journey, I should say “With what porpoise?”’  \n\n‘Don’t you mean “purpose”?’\\* said Alice.  \n\n‘I mean what I say,’ the Mock Turtle replied, in an offended tone. And the Gryphon added ‘Come, let’s hear some of your adventures.’  \n\n‘I could tell you my adventures––beginning from this morning,’  said  Alice  a  little  timidly;  ‘but  it’s  no  use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then.’  \n\n‘Explain all that,’ said the Mock Turtle.  \n\n‘No, no! The adventures first,’ said the Gryphon in an impatient tone: ‘explanations take such a dreadful time.’",

The adventures first,’ said the Gryphon in an impatient tone: ‘explanations take such a dreadful time.’  \n\nSo Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it, just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so very wide; but she gained courage as she went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating ‘You are old, Father William,’ to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said ‘That’s very curious!’  \n\n‘It’s all about as curious as it can be,’ said the Gryphon.  \n\n‘It all came different!’ the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. ‘I should like to hear her try and repeat something now.  \n\nTell her to begin.’ He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.  \n\n‘Stand up and repeat “ ’Tis  the  voice  of  the sluggard,”’ said the Gryphon.  \n\n‘How  the  creatures order  one  about,  and make one repeat lessons!’ thought Alice. ‘I might just as well be at school at  once.’  However,  she got  up,  and  began  to repeat it, but her head was so full of the LobsterQuadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying; and the words came very queer indeed:––  \n\n![](images/image_2.jpg)  \n\n‘ ’Tis the voice of the Lobster:\\* I heard him declare “You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.” As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes. When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark, And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark: But, when the tide rises and sharks are around, His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.’  \n\n‘That’s different from what $I$ used to say when I was a child,’ said the Gryphon.  \n\n‘Well, $I$ never heard it before,’ said the Mock Turtle; ‘but it sounds uncommon nonsense.’  \n\nAlice said nothing: she had sat down with her face in her hands, wondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way again.  \n\n‘I  should  like  to  have  it  explained,’  said  the  Mock  \n\nTurtle. ‘She ca’n’t explain it,’ said the Gryphon hastily. ‘Go on   \nwith the next verse.’ ‘But about his toes?’ the Mock Turtle persisted. ‘How   \ncould he turn them out with his nose, you know?’ ‘It’s the first position in dancing,’\\* Alice said; but she was   \ndreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change   \nthe subject.  \n\n‘Go on with the next verse,’ the Gryphon repeated: ‘it begins “I passed by his garden.”’  \n\nAlice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:––  \n\n‘I passed by his garden,\\* and marked, with one eye, How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie: The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat, While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat. When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon, Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon: While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl, And concluded the banquet by—  \n\n‘What is the use of repeating all that stuff?’ the Mock Turtle interrupted, ‘if you don’t explain it as you go on? It’s by far the most confusing thing $I$ ever heard!’  \n\n‘Yes, I think you’d better leave off,’ said the Gryphon, and Alice was only too glad to do so.  \n\n‘Shall we try another figure of the Lobster-Quadrille?’ the Gryphon went on. ‘Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you another song?’  \n\n‘Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,’ Alice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone, ‘Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her “Turtle Soup,” will you, old fellow?’  \n\nThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice choked with sobs, to sing this:––  \n\n‘Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,\\* Waiting in a hot tureen!

In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them––‘I wish they’d get the trial done,’ she thought, ‘and hand round the refreshments!’ But there seemed to be no chance of this; so she began looking at everything about her to pass away the time.  \n\nAlice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there. ‘That’s the judge,’ she said to herself, ‘because of his great wig.’  \n\nThe judge, by the way, was the King; and, as he wore his crown over the wig (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it), he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.  \n\n‘And that’s the jury-box,’ thought Alice; ‘and those twelve creatures,’ (she was obliged to say ‘creatures,’ you see, because some of them were animals, and some were birds,) ‘I suppose they are the jurors.’ She said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, ‘jurymen’ would have done just as well.  \n\nThe twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. ‘What are they doing?’ Alice whispered to the Gryphon.  \n\n‘They ca’n’t have anything to put down yet, before the trial’s begun.’  \n\n‘They’re putting down their names,’ the Gryphon whispered in reply, ‘for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.’  \n\n‘Stupid things!’ Alice began in a loud indignant voice; but she stopped herself hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out ‘Silence in the court!’, and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who was talking.  \n\nAlice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down ‘Stupid things!’ on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them didn’t know how to spell ‘stupid,’ and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. ‘A nice muddle their slates’ll be in, before the trial’s over!’ thought Alice.  \n\nOne of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This, of course, Alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking  \n\nit away. She did it so quickly  that  the  poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make  out  at  all  what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write  with  one  finger for the rest of the day; and  this  was  of  very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.  \n\n‘Herald, read the accusation!’ said the King.  \n\nOn  this  the  White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet,  \n\n![](images/image_3.jpg)  \n\nand then unrolled the parchment-scroll, and read as follows:––  \n\n‘The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,\\* All on a summer day:   \nThe Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts And took them quite away!’  \n\n‘Consider your verdict,’ the King said to the jury.  \n\n‘Not yet, not yet!’ the Rabbit hastily interrupted. ‘There’s a great deal to come before that!’  \n\n‘Call the first witness,’ said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out ‘First witness!’  \n\nThe first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. ‘I beg pardon, your Majesty,’ he began, ‘for bringing these in; but I hadn’t quite finished my tea when I was sent for.’  \n\n‘You ought to have finished,’ said the King. ‘When did you begin?’",

He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. ‘I beg pardon, your Majesty,’ he began, ‘for bringing these in; but I hadn’t quite finished my tea when I was sent for.’  \n\n‘You ought to have finished,’ said the King. ‘When did you begin?’  \n\nThe Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. ‘Fourteenth of March, I think it was,’ he said.  \n\n‘Fifteenth,’ said the March Hare.   \n‘Sixteenth,’ said the Dormouse.  \n\n‘Write that down,’ the King said to the jury; and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.  \n\n‘Take off your hat,’ the King said to the Hatter.  \n\n‘It isn’t mine,’ said the Hatter.  \n\n‘Stolen!’ the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a memorandum of the fact.  \n\n‘I keep them to sell,’ the Hatter added as an explanation. ‘I’ve none of my own. I’m a hatter.’  \n\nHere the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring hard at the Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted.  \n\n‘Give your evidence,’ said the King; ‘and don’t be nervous, or I’ll have you executed on the spot.  \n\nThis did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.  \n\nJust at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her.  \n\n‘I wish you wouldn’t squeeze so,’ said the Dormouse, who was sitting next to her. ‘I can hardly breathe.’  \n\n‘I ca’n’t help it,’ said Alice very meekly: ‘I’m growing.  \n\n‘You’ve no right to grow here,’ said the Dormouse.  \n\n‘Don’t talk nonsense,’ said Alice more boldly: ‘you know you’re growing too.’  \n\n‘Yes, but $I$ grow at a reasonable pace,’ said the Dormouse: ‘not in that ridiculous fashion.’ And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other  \n\nAll this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said, to one of the offi- cers of the court, ‘Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!’ on which the wretched  Hatter  trembled so, that he shook off both his shoes.  \n\n‘Give your evidence,’ the King repeated angrily, ‘or I’ll have you executed, whether you’re nervous or not.’  \n\n![](images/image_4.jpg)  \n\n‘I’m a poor man, your Majesty,’ the Hatter began, in a trembling voice, ‘and I hadn’t begun my tea––not above a week or so––and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin–– and the twinkling of the tea——  \n\n‘The twinkling of what?’ said the King.  \n\n‘It began with the tea,’ the Hatter replied.  \n\n‘Of course twinkling begins with a T!’ said the King sharply. ‘Do you take me for a dunce? Go on!’  \n\n‘I’m a poor man,’ the Hatter went on, ‘and most things twinkled after that––only the March Hare said—  \n\n‘I didn’t!’ the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.  \n\n‘You did!’ said the Hatter.  \n\n‘I deny it!’ said the March Hare.  \n\n‘He denies it,’ said the King: ‘leave out that part.’  \n\n‘Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said——’ the Hatter went on, looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it  too;  but  the  Dormouse  denied  nothing,  being  fast asleep.  \n\n‘After that,’ continued the Hatter, ‘I cut some more breadand-butter—  \n\n‘But what did the Dormouse say?’ one of the jury asked.  \n\n‘That I ca’n’t remember,’ said the Hatter.  \n\n‘You must remember,’ remarked the King, ‘or I’ll have you executed.’  \n\nThe miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-andbutter, and went down on one knee. ‘I’m a poor man, your Majesty,’ he began.  \n\n‘You’re a very poor speaker,’ said the King.  \n\nHere one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat upon it.)  \n\n‘I’m glad I’ve seen that done,’ thought Alice. ‘I’ve so often read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, “There was some attempt at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court,” and I never understood what it  \n\nmeant till now.’ ‘If that’s all you know about it, you",

Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed. ‘Come, that finishes the guinea-pigs!’ thought Alice. ‘Now   \nwe shall get on better.’ ‘I’d rather finish my tea,’ said the Hatter, with an anxious   \nlook at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.  \n\n‘You may go,’ said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court, without even waiting to put his shoes on.  \n\n![](images/image_5.jpg)  \n\nand just take his head off outside,’ the Queen added to one of the officers; but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door.  \n\n‘Call the next witness!’ said the King.  \n\nThe next witness was the Duchess’s cook. She carried the pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.  \n\n‘Give your evidence,’ said the King.   \n‘Sha’n’t,’ said the cook.  \n\nThe King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said, in  a  low  voice,  ‘Your  Majesty  must  cross-examine  this witness.’  \n\n‘Well, if I must, I must,’ the King said with a melancholy air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said, in a deep voice, ‘What are tarts made of?’  \n\n‘Pepper, mostly,’ said the cook.  \n\n‘Treacle,’ said a sleepy voice behind her.  \n\n‘Collar that Dormouse!’ the Queen shrieked out. ‘Behead that Dormouse! Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his whiskers!’  \n\nFor some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had disappeared.  \n\n‘Never mind!’ said the King, with an air of great relief. ‘Call the next witness.’ And, he added, in an under-tone to the Queen, ‘Really, my dear, you must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my forehead ache!’  \n\nAlice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like, ‘––for they haven’t got much evidence yet,’ she said to herself. Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the name ‘Alice!’  \n\n![](images/image_6.jpg)  \nCHAPTER XII  \n\n# alice’s evidence\\*  \n\n‘Here!’ cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jurybox with the edge of her skirt,\\* upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of gold-fish she had accidentally upset the week before.  \n\n‘Oh, I beg your pardon!’ she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of the gold-fish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.  \n\n‘The trial cannot proceed,’ said the King, in a very grave voice, ‘until all the jurymen are back in their proper places–– all,’ he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.  \n\nAlice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon got it out again, and put it right; ‘not that it signifies much,’ she said to herself; ‘I should think it would be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the other.’  \n\nAs soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the court.  \n\n‘What do you know about this business?’ the King said to Alice. ‘Nothing,’ said Alice. ‘Nothing whatever?’ persisted the King. ‘Nothing whatever,’ said Alice. ‘That’s very important,’ the King said, turning to the jury. They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit interrupted: ‘Unimportant, your Majesty means, of course,’ he said, in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke.  \n\n‘Unimportant, of course,",

They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit interrupted: ‘Unimportant, your Majesty means, of course,’ he said, in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke.  \n\n‘Unimportant, of course, I meant,’ the King hastily said, and  went  on  to  himself  in  an  undertone,  ‘important–– unimportant––unimportant––important— ’ as if he were trying which word sounded best.  \n\nSome of the jury wrote it down ‘important,’ and some ‘unimportant.’ Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates; ‘but it doesn’t matter a bit,’ she thought to herself.  \n\nAt this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in his note-book, called out ‘Silence!’, and read out from his book, ‘Rule Forty-two.\\* All persons more than a mile high to leave the court.’  \n\nEverybody looked at Alice. ‘I’m not a mile high,’ said Alice. ‘You are,’ said the King. ‘Nearly two miles high,’ added the Queen. ‘Well, I sha’n’t go, at any rate,’ said Alice: ‘besides, that’s not a regular rule: you invented it just now.’ ‘It’s the oldest rule in the book,’ said the King. ‘Then it ought to be Number One,’ said Alice. The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. ‘Consider your verdict,’ he said to the jury, in a low trembling voice.  \n\n‘There’s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty, said the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry: ‘this paper has just been picked up.  \n\n‘What’s in it?’ said the Queen.  \n\n‘I haven’t opened it yet,’ said the White Rabbit; ‘but it seems to be a letter, written by the prisoner to––to somebody.’  \n\n‘It must have been that,’ said the King, ‘unless it was written to nobody, which isn’t usual, you know.’  \n\n‘Who is it directed to?’ said one of the jurymen.  \n\n‘It isn’t directed at all,’ said the White Rabbit: ‘in fact, there’s nothing written on the outside.’ He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and added ‘It isn’t a letter, after all: it’s a set of verses.’  \n\n‘Are they in the prisoner’s handwriting?’ asked another of the jurymen.  \n\n‘No, they’re not,’ said the White Rabbit, ‘and that’s the queerest thing about it.’ (The jury all looked puzzled.) ‘He must have imitated somebody else’s hand,’ said the King. (The jury all brightened up again.)  \n\n‘Please your Majesty,’ said the Knave, ‘I didn’t write it, and they ca’n’t prove that I did: there’s no name signed at the end.’  \n\n‘If you didn’t sign it,’ said the King, ‘that only makes the matter worse. You must have meant some mischief, or else you’d have signed your name like an honest man.’  \n\nThere was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really clever thing the King had said that day.  \n\n‘That proves his guilt, of course,’ said the Queen: ‘so, off with– ––  \n\n‘It doesn’t prove anything of the sort!’ said Alice. ‘Why, you don’t even know what they’re about!’  \n\n‘Read them,’ said the King.  \n\nThe White Rabbit put on his spectacles. ‘Where shall I begin, please your Majesty?’ he asked.  \n\n‘Begin at the beginning,’ the King said, very gravely, ‘and go on till you come to the end: then stop.’  \n\nThere was dead silence in the court, whilst the White Rabbit read out these verses:––  \n\n‘They told me you had been to her,\\* And mentioned me to him: She gave me a good character, But said I could not swim.  \n\nHe sent them word I had not gone (We know it to be true): If she should push the matter on, What would become of you?  \n\nI gave her one, they gave him two, You gave us three or more; They all returned from him to you, Though they were mine before.  \n\nIf I or she should chance to be Involved in this affair, He trusts to you to set them free, Exactly as we were.  \n\nMy notion was that you had been (Before she had this fit) An obstacle that came between Him, and ourselves, and it.  \n\nDon’t let him know she liked them best, For this must ever be   \n$A$ secret, kept from all the rest, Between yourself and me.’  \n\n‘That’s the most important piece of evidence we’ve heard yet,’ said the King, rubbing his hands; ‘so now let the jury——  \n\n‘If any one of them can explain it,’ said Alice, (she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn’t a bit afraid of interrupting him,) ‘I’ll give him sixpence. $I$ don’t believe there’s an atom of meaning in it.’  \n\nThe jury all wrote down, on their slates, ‘She doesn’t believe there’s an atom of meaning in it,’ but none of them attempted to explain the paper.  \n\n‘If there’s no meaning in it,’ said the King, ‘that saves a world of trouble, you know, as we needn’t try to find any",

(Which he certainly did not, being made entirely of cardboard.)  \n\n‘All right, so far,’ said the King; and he went on muttering over the verses to himself: ‘“We know it to be true”–– that’s the jury, of course––“If she should push the matter on” ––that must be the Queen––“What would become of you?”–– What, indeed!–– $^{\\epsilon}I$ gave her one, they gave him two”––why, that must be what he did with the tarts, you know——  \n\n‘But it goes on “they all returned from him to you,”’ said Alice.  \n\n![](images/image_7.jpg)  \n\n‘Why, there they are?’ said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts on the table. ‘Nothing can be clearer than that. Then again––“before she had this fit”––you never had fits, my dear, I think?’ he said to the Queen.  \n\n‘Never!’  said  the  Queen, furiously, throwing an inkstand at  the  Lizard  as  she  spoke. (The  unfortunate  little  Bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)  \n\n![](images/image_8.jpg)  \n\n‘Then the words don’t fit you,’ said the King, looking round the court with a smile. There was a dead silence.  \n\n‘It’s a pun!’ the King added in an angry tone, and everybody laughed. ‘Let the jury consider their verdict,’ the King said, for about the twentieth time that day.  \n\n‘No, no!’ said the Queen. ‘Sentence first––verdict afterwards.’  \n\n‘Stuff and nonsense!’ said Alice loudly. ‘The idea of having the sentence first!’  \n\n‘Hold your tongue!’ said the Queen, turning purple.   \n‘I wo’n’t!’ said Alice.  \n\n‘Off with her head!’ the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody moved.  \n\n‘Who cares for you?’ said Alice (she had grown to her full size by this time). ‘You’re nothing but a pack of cards!’  \n\nAt this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her; she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.  \n\n![](images/image_9.jpg)  \n\n‘Wake up, Alice dear!’ said her sister. ‘Why, what a long sleep you’ve had!’  \n\n‘Oh, I’ve had such a curious dream!’\\* said Alice. And she told her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and, when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said ‘It was a curious dream, dear, certainly; but now run in to your tea: it’s getting late.’ So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.  \n\nBut her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:––\\*  \n\nFirst, she dreamed about little Alice herself: once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers––she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that would always get into her eyes–– and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister’s dream.  \n\nThe long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by––the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool––she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their neverending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution––once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the Duchess’ knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it––once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard’s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air, mixed up with the distant sob of the miserable Mock Turtle.  \n\nSo she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to",

Macmillan & Co., 29 Bedford Street, Covent Garden, with their names and addresses; and copies of the next issue shall be sent them in exchange.  \n\nInstead, however, of destroying the unsold copies, I propose to utilise them by giving them away, to Mechanics’ Institutes, Village Reading-Rooms, and similar institutions, where the means for purchasing such books are scanty. Accordingly I invite applications for such gifts, addressed to me, ‘care of Messrs. Macmillan.’ Every such application should be signed by some responsible person, and should state how far they are able to buy books for themselves, and what is the average number of readers.  \n\nI take this opportunity of announcing that, if at any future time I should wish to communicate anything to my Readers, I will do so by advertising, in the ‘Agony’ Column of some of the Daily Papers, on the first Tuesday in the month.  \n\nLewis Carroll Christmas, 1893  \n\n# PREFACE TO THE SIXTY-FIRST THOUSAND  \n\nAs the chess-problem,\\* given on a previous page, has puzzled some of my readers, it may be well to explain that it is correctly worked out, so far as the moves are concerned. The alternation of Red and White is perhaps not so strictly observed as it might be, and the ‘castling’ of the three Queens is merely a way of saying that they entered the palace: but the ‘check’ of the White King at move 6, the capture of the Red Knight at move 7, and the final ‘checkmate’ of the Red King, will be found, by any one who will take the trouble to set the pieces and play the moves as directed, to be strictly in accordance with the laws of the game.  \n\nThe new words, in the poem ‘Jabberwocky’ (see p. 134), have given rise to some differences of opinion as to their pronunciation: so it may be well to give instructions on that point also. Pronounce ‘slithy’ as if it were the two words ‘sly, the’: make the ‘g’ hard in ‘gyre’ and ‘gimble’: and pronounce ‘rath’ to rhyme with ‘bath.’  \n\nFor this sixty-first thousand, fresh electrotypes have been taken from the wood-blocks (which, never having been used for printing from, are in as good condition as when first cut in $\\phantom{}_{\\displaystyle\\mathrm{I}}87\\phantom{}$ ), and the whole book has been set up afresh with new type. If the artistic qualities of this re-issue fall short, in any particular, of those possessed by the original issue, it will not be for want of painstaking on the part of author, publisher, or printer.  \n\nI take this opportunity of announcing that the Nursery ‘Alice,’ hitherto priced at four shillings, net, is now to be had on the same terms as the ordinary shilling picture-books–– although I feel sure that it is, in every quality (except the text itself, on which I am not qualified to pronounce), greatly superior to them. Four shillings was a perfectly reasonable price to charge, considering the very heavy initial outlay I had incurred: still, as the Public have practically said ‘We will not give more than a shilling for a picture-book, however artistically got-up,’ I am content to reckon my outlay on the book as so much dead loss, and, rather than let the little ones, for whom it was written, go without it, I am selling it at a price which is, to me, much the same thing as giving it away.  \n\nChristmas, 1896  \n\n# This page intentionally left blank  \n\n# CONTENTS  \n\ni. looking-glass house page 123   \nii. the garden of live flowers 137   \niii. looking-glass insects 148   \niv. tweedledum and tweedledee 159   \nv. wool and water 173   \nvi. humpty dumpty 185   \nvii. the lion and the unicorn 198   \nviii. ‘it’s my own invention’ 209   \nix. queen alice 224   \nx. shaking 240   \nxi. waking 241   \nxii. which dreamed it? 242  \n\n# This page intentionally left blank  \n\n![](images/image_12.jpg)  \n\n# CHAPTER I  \n\nlooking-glass house  \n\nOne thing was certain, that the white kitten had had nothing to do with it\\*––it was the black kitten’s fault entirely.

You ought, Dinah, you know you ought!’ she added, looking reproachfully at the old cat, and speaking in as cross a voice as she could manage––and then she scrambled back into the arm-chair, taking the kitten and the worsted with her, and began winding up the ball again. But she didn’t get on very fast, as she was talking all the time, sometimes to the kitten, and sometimes to herself. Kitty sat very demurely on her knee, pretending to watch the progress of the winding, and now and then putting out one paw and gently touching the ball, as if it would be glad to help if it might.  \n\n![](images/image_13.jpg)  \n\n‘Do you know what to-morrow is,\\* Kitty?’ Alice began. ‘You’d have guessed if you’d been up in the window with me ––only Dinah was making you tidy, so you couldn’t. I was watching the boys getting in sticks for the bonfire––and it wants plenty of sticks, Kitty! Only it got so cold, and it snowed so, they had to leave off. Never mind, Kitty, we’ll go and see the bonfire to-morrow.’ Here Alice wound two or three turns of the worsted round the kitten’s neck, just to see how it would look: this led to a scramble, in which the ball rolled down upon the floor, and yards and yards of it got unwound again.  \n\n‘Do you know, I was so angry, Kitty,’ Alice went on, as soon as they were comfortably settled again, ‘when I saw all the mischief you had been doing, I was very nearly opening the window, and putting you out into the snow! And you’d have deserved it, you little mischievous darling! What have you got to say for yourself? Now don’t interrupt me!’ she went on, holding up one finger. ‘I’m going to tell you all your faults. Number one: you squeaked twice while Dinah was washing your face this morning. Now you ca’n’t deny it, Kitty: I heard you! What’s that you say?’ (pretending that the kitten was speaking). ‘Her paw went into your eye? Well, that’s your fault, for keeping your eyes open––if you’d shut them tight up, it wouldn’t have happened. Now don’t make any more excuses, but listen! Number two: you pulled Snowdrop\\* away by the tail just as I had put down the saucer of milk before her! What, you were thirsty, were you? How do you know she wasn’t thirsty too? Now for number three: you  unwound  every  bit  of  the  worsted  while  I  wasn’t looking!  \n\n‘That’s three faults, Kitty, and you’ve not been punished for any of them yet. You know I’m saving up all your punishments for Wednesday week––Suppose they had saved up all my punishments?’ she went on, talking more to herself than the kitten. ‘What would they do at the end of a year? I should be sent to prison, I suppose, when the day came. Or––let me see––suppose each punishment was to be going without a dinner: then, when the miserable day came, I should have to go without fifty dinners at once! Well, I shouldn’t mind that  much!  I’d  far  rather  go  without  them  than  eat them!  \n\n‘Do you hear the snow against the window-panes, Kitty? How nice and soft it sounds! Just as if some one was kissing the window all over outside. I wonder if the snow loves the trees and fields, that it kisses them so gently? And then it covers them up snug, you know, with a white quilt; and perhaps it says “Go to sleep, darlings, till the summer comes again.” And when they wake up in the summer, Kitty, they dress themselves all in green, and dance about––whenever the wind blows––oh, that’s very pretty!’ cried Alice, dropping the ball of worsted to clap her hands. ‘And I do so wish it was true! I’m sure the woods look sleepy in the autumn, when the leaves are getting brown.  \n\n‘Kitty, can you play chess? Now, don’t smile, my dear, I’m asking it seriously. Because, when we were playing just now, you watched just as if you understood it: and when I said “Check!” you purred! Well, it was a nice check, Kitty, and really I might have won, if it hadn’t been for that nasty Knight, that came wriggling down among my pieces. Kitty",

Because, when we were playing just now, you watched just as if you understood it: and when I said “Check!” you purred! Well, it was a nice check, Kitty, and really I might have won, if it hadn’t been for that nasty Knight, that came wriggling down among my pieces. Kitty, dear, let’s pretend— ’ And here I wish I could tell you half the things Alice used to say, beginning with her favourite phrase ‘Let’s pretend.’ She had had quite a long argument with her sister only the day before––all because Alice had begun with ‘Let’s pretend we’re kings and queens;’ and her sister, who liked being very exact, had argued that they couldn’t, because there were only two of them, and Alice had been reduced at last to say ‘Well, you can be one of them, then, and I’ll be all the rest.’ And once she had really frightened her old nurse by shouting suddenly in her ear, ‘Nurse! Do let’s pretend that I’m a hungry hyæna, and you’re a bone!’  \n\nBut this is taking us away from Alice’s speech to the kitten.  \n\n‘Let’s pretend that you’re the Red Queen,\\* Kitty! Do you know, I think if you sat up and folded your arms, you’d look exactly like her. Now do try, there’s a dear!’ And Alice got the Red Queen off the table, and set it up before the kitten as a model for it to imitate: however, the thing didn’t succeed, principally, Alice said, because the kitten wouldn’t fold its arms properly. So, to punish it, she held it up to the Lookingglass, that it might see how sulky it was, ‘––and if you’re not good directly,’ she added, ‘I’ll put you through into Lookingglass House. How would you like that?  \n\n‘Now, if you’ll only attend, Kitty, and not talk so much, I’ll tell you all my ideas about Looking-glass House. First, there’s the room you can see through the glass––that’s just the same as our drawing-room, only the things go the other way. I can see all of it when I get upon a chair––all but the bit just behind the fireplace. Oh! I do so wish I could see that bit! I want so much to know whether they’ve a fire in the winter: you never can tell, you know, unless our fire smokes, and then smoke comes up in that room too––but that may be only pretence, just to make it look as if they had a fire. Well then, the books are something like our books, only the words go the wrong way: I know that, because I’ve held up one of our books to the glass, and then they hold up one in the other room.  \n\n‘How would you like to live in Looking-glass House, Kitty? I wonder if they’d give you milk in there? Perhaps Lookingglass milk isn’t good to drink––but oh, Kitty! now we come to the passage. You can just see a little peep of the passage in Looking-glass House, if you leave the door of our drawingroom wide open: and it’s very like our passage as far as you can see, only you know it may be quite different on beyond. Oh, Kitty, how nice it would be if we could only get through into Looking-glass House! I’m sure it’s got, oh! such beautiful things in it! Let’s pretend there’s a way of getting through into it, somehow, Kitty. Let’s pretend the glass has got all soft like gauze, so that we can get through. Why, it’s turning into a sort of mist now, I declare! It’ll be easy enough to get  \n\n![](images/image_14.jpg)  \nthrough——’ She was up on the chimney-piece while she said this, though she hardly knew how she had got there. And certainly the glass was beginning to melt away, just like a bright silvery mist.  \n\nIn another moment Alice was through the glass, and had jumped lightly down into the Looking-glass room. The very first thing she did was to look whether there was a fire in the fireplace, and she was quite pleased to find that there was a real one, blazing away as brightly as the one she had left behind. ‘So I shall be as warm here as I was in the old room,’ thought Alice: ‘warmer, in fact, because there’ll be no one  \n\n![](images/image_15.jpg)  \nhere to scold me away from the fire. Oh, what fun it’ll be, when they see me through the glass in here, and ca’n’t get at me!’  \n\nThen she began looking about, and noticed that what could be seen from the old room was quite common and uninteresting, but that all the rest was as different as possible. For instance, the pictures on the wall next the fire seemed to be  all  alive,  and  the  very  clock  on  the  chimney-piece (you know you can only see the back of it in the Lookingglass) had got the face of a little old man, and grinned at her.  \n\n‘They don’t keep this room so tidy as the other,’ Alice thought to herself, as she noticed several of the chessmen down in the hearth among the cinders; but in another moment, with a little ‘Oh!’ of surprise, she was down on her hands and knees watching them. The chessmen were walking about, two and two!  \n\n![](images/image_",

The chessmen were walking about, two and two!  \n\n![](images/image_16.jpg)  \n\n‘Here are the Red King and the Red Queen,’ Alice said (in a whisper, for fear of frightening them), ‘and there are the White King and the White Queen\\* sitting on the edge of the shovel––and here are two Castles walking arm in arm––I don’t think they can hear me,’ she went on, as she put her head closer down, ‘and I’m nearly sure they ca’n’t see me. I feel somehow as if I was getting invisible—  \n\nHere something began squeaking on the table behind Alice, and made her turn her head just in time to see one of the White Pawns roll over and begin kicking: she watched it with great curiosity to see what would happen next.  \n\n‘It is the voice of my child!’ the White Queen cried out, as she rushed past the King, so violently that she knocked him over among the cinders. ‘My precious Lily! My imperial kitten!’\\* and she began scrambling wildly up the side of the fender.  \n\n‘Imperial fiddlestick!’ said the King, rubbing his nose, which had been hurt by the fall. He had a right to be a little annoyed with the Queen, for he was covered with ashes from head to foot.  \n\nAlice was very anxious to be of use, and, as the poor little Lily was nearly screaming herself into a fit, she hastily picked up the Queen and set her on the table by the side of her noisy little daughter.  \n\nThe Queen gasped, and sat down: the rapid journey through the air had quite taken away her breath, and for a minute or two she could do nothing but hug the little Lily in silence. As soon as she had recovered her breath a little, she called out to the White King, who was sitting sulkily among the ashes, ‘Mind the volcano!’  \n\n‘What volcano?’ said the King, looking up anxiously into the fire, as if he thought that was the most likely place to find one.  \n\n‘Blew––me––up,’ panted the Queen, who was still a little out of breath. ‘Mind you come up––the regular way––don’t get blown up!’  \n\nAlice watched the White King as he slowly struggled up from bar to bar, till at last she said ‘Why, you’ll be hours and hours getting to the table, at that rate. I’d far better help you, hadn’t I?’ But the King took no notice of the question: it was quite clear that he could neither hear her nor see her.  \n\nSo Alice picked him up very gently, and lifted him across more slowly than she had lifted the Queen, that she mightn’t take his breath away; but, before she put him on the table, she thought she might as well dust him a little, he was so covered with ashes.  \n\nShe said afterwards that she had never seen in all her life such a face as the King made, when he found himself held in the air by an invisible hand, and being dusted: he was far too much astonished to cry out, but his eyes and his mouth went on getting larger and larger, and rounder and rounder, till her hand shook so with laughing that she nearly let him drop upon the floor.  \n\n![](images/image_17.jpg)  \n\n‘Oh! please don’t make such faces, my dear!’ she cried out, quite forgetting that the King couldn’t hear her. ‘You make me laugh so that I can hardly hold you! And don’t keep your mouth so wide open! All the ashes will get into it––there, now I think you’re tidy enough!’ she added, as she smoothed his hair, and set him upon the table near the Queen.  \n\nThe King immediately fell flat on his back, and lay perfectly still; and Alice was a little alarmed at what she had done, and went round the room to see if she could find any water to throw over him. However, she could find nothing but a bottle of ink, and when she got back with it she found he had recovered, and he and the Queen were talking together in a frightened whisper––so low, that Alice could hardly hear what they said.  \n\nThe King was saying ‘I assure you, my dear, I turned cold to the very ends of my whiskers!’  \n\nTo which the Queen replied ‘You haven’t got any whiskers.’  \n\n‘The horror of that moment,’ the King went on, ‘I shall never, never forget!’  \n\n‘You will, though,’ the Queen said, ‘if you don’t make a memorandum of it.’  \n\nAlice looked on with great interest as the King took an enormous memorandum-book out of his pocket, and began writing. A sudden thought struck her, and she took hold of the end of the pencil, which came some way over his shoulder, and began writing for him.  \n\nThe poor King looked puzzled and unhappy, and struggled with the pencil for some time without saying anything; but Alice was too strong for him, and at last he panted out ‘My  \n\ndear! I really must get a thinner  pencil.  I  ca’n’t manage this one a bit: it writes all manner of things  that  I  don’t  intend—  \n\n‘What manner of things?’ said the Queen, looking  over  the  book",

He balances very badly’). ‘That’s not a memorandum of your feelings!’  \n\n![](images/image_18.jpg)  \n\nThere was a book lying near Alice on the table, and while she sat watching the White King (for she was still a little anxious about him, and had the ink all ready to throw over him, in case he fainted again), she turned over the leaves, to find some part that she could read, ‘––for it’s all in some language I don’t know,’ she said to herself.  \n\nIt was like this.  \n\n# .YKCOWREBBAJ\\*  \n\nsevot yhtils eht dna ,gillirb sawT‘ :ebaw eht ni elbmig dna eryg diD ,sevogorob eht erew ysmim llA .ebargtuo shtar emom eht dnA  \n\nShe puzzled over this for some time, but at last a bright thought struck her. ‘Why, it’s a Looking-glass book, of course! And, if I hold it up to a glass, the words will all go the right way again.’  \n\nThis was the poem that Alice read.’  \n\n# JABBERWOCKY.  \n\n’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: All mimsy were the borogoves, And the mome raths outgrabe.  \n\n‘Beware the Jabberwock, my son! The jaws that bite, the claws that catch! Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun The frumious Bandersnatch!’  \n\nHe took his vorpal sword in hand: Long time the manxome foe he sought–– So rested he by the Tumtum tree, And stood awhile in thought.  \n\nAnd, as in uffish thought he stood, The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame, Came whiffling through the tulgey wood, And burbled as it came!  \n\n![](images/image_19.jpg)  \n\nOne, two! One, two! And through and through The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!   \nHe left it dead, and with its head He went galumphing back.   \n‘And, hast thou slain the Jabberwock? Come to my arms, my beamish boy!   \nO frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!’ He chortled in his joy.   \n’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:   \nAll mimsy were the borogoves, And the mome raths outgrabe.  \n\n‘It seems very pretty,’ she said when she had finished it, ‘but it’s rather hard to understand!’ (You see she didn’t like to confess, even to herself, that she couldn’t make it out at all.) ‘Somehow it seems to fill my head with ideas––only I don’t exactly know what they are! However, somebody killed something: that’s clear, at any rate— ’  \n\n‘But oh!’ thought Alice, suddenly jumping up, ‘if I don’t make haste, I shall have to go back through the Looking-glass, before I’ve seen what the rest of the house is like! Let’s have a look at the garden first!’ She was out of the room in a moment, and ran down stairs––or, at least, it wasn’t exactly running, but a new invention for getting down stairs quickly and easily, as Alice said to herself. She just kept the tips of her fingers on the hand-rail, and floated gently down without even touching the stairs with her feet: then she floated on through the hall, and would have gone straight out at the door in the same way, if she hadn’t caught hold of the door-post. She was getting a little giddy with so much floating in the air, and was rather glad to find herself walking again in the natural way.  \n\n# CHAPTER II  \n\nthe garden of live flowers\\* ‘I should see the garden far better,’ said Alice to herself, ‘if I could get to the top of that hill: and here’s a path that leads straight to it––at least, no, it doesn’t do that——’ (after going a few yards along the path, and turning several sharp corners), ‘but I suppose it will at last. But how curiously it twists! It’s more like a corkscrew than a path! Well, this turn goes to the hill, I suppose––no, it doesn’t! This goes straight back to the house! Well then, I’ll try it the other way.’  \n\nAnd so she did: wandering up and down, and trying turn after turn, but always coming back to the house, do what she would. Indeed, once, when she turned a corner rather more quickly than usual, she ran against it before she could stop herself.  \n\n‘It’s no use talking about it,’ Alice said, looking up at the house and pretending it was arguing with her. ‘I’m not going in again yet. I know I should have to get through the Lookingglass again––back into the old room––and there’d be an end of all",

I know I should have to get through the Lookingglass again––back into the old room––and there’d be an end of all my adventures!’  \n\nSo, resolutely turning her back upon the house, she set out once more down the path, determined to keep straight on till she got to the hill. For a few minutes all went on well, and she was just saying ‘I really shall do it this time——’ when the path gave a sudden twist and shook itself (as she described it afterwards), and the next moment she found herself actually walking in at the door.  \n\n‘Oh, it’s too bad!’ she cried. ‘I never saw such a house for getting in the way! Never!’  \n\nHowever, there was the hill full in sight, so there was nothing to be done but start again. This time she came upon a large flower-bed, with a border of daisies, and a willow-tree growing in the middle.  \n\n![](images/image_20.jpg)  \n\n‘O Tiger-lily!’\\* said Alice, addressing herself to one that was waving gracefully about in the wind, ‘I wish you could talk!’  \n\n‘We can talk,’ said the Tiger-lily, ‘when there’s anybody worth talking to.’  \n\nAlice was so astonished that she couldn’t speak for a minute: it quite seemed to take her breath away. At length, as the Tiger-lily only went on waving about, she spoke again, in a timid voice––almost in a whisper. ‘And can all the flowers talk?’  \n\n‘As well as you can,’ said the Tiger-lily. ‘And a great deal louder.’  \n\n‘It isn’t manners for us to begin, you know,’ said the Rose,\\* ‘and I really was wondering when you’d speak! Said I to myself, “Her face has got some sense in it, though it’s not a clever one!” Still, you’re the right colour, and that goes a long way.’  \n\n‘I don’t care about the colour,’ the Tiger-lily remarked. ‘If only her petals curled up a little more, she’d be all right.’  \n\nAlice didn’t like being criticized, so she began asking questions. ‘Aren’t you sometimes frightened at being planted out here, with nobody to take care of you?’  \n\n‘There’s the tree in the middle,’ said the Rose. ‘What else is it good for?’  \n\n‘But  what  could  it  do,  if  any  danger  came?’  Alice asked.  \n\n‘It could bark,’ said the Rose.  \n\n‘It says “Bough-wough!”’ cried a Daisy. ‘That’s why its branches are called boughs!’  \n\n‘Didn’t you know that?’ cried another Daisy. And here they all began shouting together, till the air seemed quite full of little shrill voices. ‘Silence, every one of you!’ cried the Tiger-lily, waving itself passionately from side to side, and trembling with excitement. ‘They know I ca’n’t get at them!’ it panted, bending its quivering head towards Alice, ‘or they wouldn’t dare to do it!’  \n\n‘Never mind!’ Alice said in a soothing tone, and, stooping down to the daisies, who were just beginning again, she whispered ‘If you don’t hold your tongues, I’ll pick you!’  \n\nThere was silence in a moment, and several of the pink daisies turned white.  \n\n‘That’s right!’ said the Tiger-lily. ‘The daisies are worst of  all.  When  one  speaks,  they  all  begin  together,  and it’s  enough  to  make  one  wither  to  hear  the  way  they go on!’  \n\n‘How is it you can all talk so nicely?’ Alice said, hoping to get it into a better temper by a compliment. ‘I’ve been in many gardens before, but none of the flowers could talk.’  \n\n‘Put your hand down, and feel the ground,’ said the Tigerlily. ‘Then you’ll know why.’  \n\nAlice did so. ‘It’s very hard,’ she said; ‘but I don’t see what that has to do with it.’  \n\n‘In most gardens,’ the Tiger-lily said, ‘they make the beds too soft––so that the flowers are always asleep.’  \n\nThis sounded a very good reason, and Alice was quite pleased to know it. ‘I never thought of that before!’ she said.  \n\n‘It’s my opinion that you never think at all,’ the Rose said, in a rather severe tone.  \n\n‘I never saw anybody that looked stupider,’ a Violet\\* said, so suddenly, that Alice quite jumped; for it hadn’t spoken before.  \n\n‘Hold your tongue!’ cried the Tiger-lily. ‘As if you ever saw anybody! You keep your head under the leaves, and snore away there, till you know no more what’s going on in the world, than if you were a bud!’  \n\n‘Are  there  any  more  people  in  the  garden  besides me?’  Alice  said,  not  choosing  to  notice  the  Rose’s  last remark.  \n\n‘There’s one other flower in the garden that can move about like you,’ said the Rose. ‘I wonder how you do it—— (‘You’re always wondering,’ said the Tiger-lily), ‘but she’s more",

I thought it was the regular rule.’  \n\n‘She’s coming!’ cried the Larkspur. ‘I hear her footstep, thump, thump, along the gravel-walk!’\\*  \n\nAlice looked round eagerly and found that it was the Red Queen. ‘She’s grown a good deal!’ was her first remark. She had indeed: when Alice first found her in the ashes, she had been only three inches high––and here she was, half a head taller than Alice herself!  \n\n‘It’s the fresh air that does it,’ said the Rose: ‘wonderfully fine air it is, out here.’  \n\n‘I think I’ll go and meet her,’ said Alice, for, though the flowers were interesting enough, she felt that it would be far grander to have a talk with a real Queen.  \n\n‘You ca’n’t possibly do that,’ said the Rose: $^{\\epsilon}I$ should advise you to walk the other way.’  \n\nThis sounded nonsense to Alice, so she said nothing, but set off at once towards the Red Queen. To her surprise she lost sight of her in a moment, and found herself walking in at the front-door again.  \n\nA little provoked, she drew back, and, after looking everywhere for the Queen (whom she spied out at last, a long way off), she thought she would try the plan, this time, of walking in the opposite direction.  \n\nIt succeeded beautifully. She had not been walking a minute before she found herself face to face with the Red Queen,\\* and full in sight of the hill she had been so long aiming at.  \n\n![](images/image_21.jpg)  \n\n‘Where do you come from?’ said the Red Queen. ‘And where are you going? Look up, speak nicely, and don’t twiddle your fingers all the time.’  \n\nAlice attended to all these directions, and explained, as well as she could, that she had lost her way.  \n\n‘I don’t know what you mean by your way,’ said the Queen: ‘all the ways about here belong to me––but why did you come out here at all?’ she added in a kinder tone. ‘Curtsey while you’re thinking what to say. It saves time.’  \n\nAlice wondered a little at this, but she was too much in awe of the Queen to disbelieve it. ‘I’ll try it when I go home,’ she thought to herself, ‘the next time I’m a little late for dinner.’  \n\n‘It’s time for you to answer now,’ the Queen said, looking at her watch: ‘open your mouth a little wider when you speak, and always say “your Majesty.”’  \n\n‘I only wanted to see what the garden was like, your Majesty—  \n\n‘That’s right,’ said the Queen, patting her on the head, which Alice didn’t like at all: ‘though, when you say “garden” ––I’ve seen gardens, compared with which this would be a wilderness.’  \n\nAlice didn’t dare to argue the point, but went on: ‘––and I thought I’d try and find my way to the top of that hill  \n\n‘When you say “hill,”’ the Queen interrupted, $^{\\epsilon}I$ could show you hills, in comparison with which you’d call that a valley.’  \n\n‘No, I shouldn’t,’ said Alice, surprised into contradicting her at last: ‘a hill ca’n’t be a valley, you know. That would be nonsense  \n\nThe Red Queen shook her head. ‘You may call it “nonsense” if you like,’ she said, ‘but I’ve heard nonsense, compared with which that would be as sensible as a dictionary!’  \n\nAlice curtseyed again, as she was afraid from the Queen’s tone that she was a little offended: and they walked on in silence till they got to the top of the little hill.\\*  \n\nFor some minutes Alice stood without speaking, looking out in all directions over the country––and a most curious country it was.

There were a number of tiny little brooks running straight across it from side to side, and the  ground  between  was  divided  up  into  squares  by  a number of little green hedges, that reached from brook to brook.  \n\n![](images/image_22.jpg)  \n\n‘I declare it’s marked out just like a large chess-board!’ Alice said at last. ‘There ought to be some men moving about somewhere––and so there are!’ she added in a tone of delight, and her heart began to beat quick with excitement as she went on. ‘It’s a great huge game of chess that’s being played––all over the world––if this is the world at all, you know. Oh, what fun it is! How I wish I was one of them! I wouldn’t mind being a Pawn, if only I might join––though of course I should like to be a Queen, best.’  \n\nShe glanced rather shyly at the real Queen as she said this, but her companion only smiled pleasantly, and said ‘That’s easily managed. You can be the White Queen’s Pawn, if you like, as Lily’s too young to play; and you’re in the Second Square to begin with: when you get to the Eighth Square you’ll be a Queen——’ Just at this moment, somehow or other, they began to run.  \n\nAlice never could quite make out, in thinking it over afterwards, how it was that they began: all she remembers is, that they were running hand in hand, and the Queen went so fast that it was all she could do to keep up with her: and still the Queen kept crying ‘Faster! Faster!’, but Alice felt she could not go faster, though she had no breath left to say so.  \n\n![](images/image_23.jpg)  \n\nThe most curious part of the thing was, that the trees and the other things round them never changed their places at all: however fast they went, they never seemed to pass anything. ‘I wonder if all the things move along with us?’ thought poor puzzled Alice. And the Queen seemed to guess her thoughts, for she cried ‘Faster! Don’t try to talk!’  \n\nNot that Alice had any idea of doing that. She felt as if she would never be able to talk again, she was getting so much out of breath: and still the Queen cried ‘Faster! Faster!’, and dragged her along. ‘Are we nearly there?’ Alice managed to pant out at last.  \n\n‘Nearly there!’ the Queen repeated. ‘Why, we passed it ten minutes ago! Faster!’ And they ran on for a time in silence, with the wind whistling in Alice’s ears, and almost blowing her hair off her head, she fancied.  \n\n‘Now! Now!’ cried the Queen. ‘Faster! Faster!’ And they went so fast that at last they seemed to skim through the air, hardly touching the ground with their feet, till suddenly, just as Alice was getting quite exhausted, they stopped, and she found herself sitting on the ground, breathless and giddy.  \n\nThe Queen propped her up against a tree, and said kindly, ‘You may rest a little, now.’  \n\nAlice looked round her in great surprise. ‘Why, I do believe we’ve been under this tree the whole time! Everything’s just as it was!’ ‘Of course it is,’ said the Queen. ‘What would you have it?’ ‘Well, in our country,’ said Alice, still panting a little, ‘you’d generally get to somewhere else––if you ran very fast for a long time as we’ve been doing. ‘A slow sort of country!’ said the Queen. ‘Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!’ ‘I’d rather not try, please!’ said Alice. ‘I’m quite content to stay here––only I am so hot and thirsty!’ ‘I know what you’d like!’ the Queen said good-naturedly, taking a little box out of her pocket. ‘Have a biscuit?’  \n\nAlice thought it would not be civil to say ‘No,’ though it wasn’t at all what she wanted. So she took it, and ate it as well as she could: and it was very dry: and she thought she had never been so nearly choked in all her life.  \n\n‘While you’re refreshing yourself,’ said the Queen, ‘I’ll just take the measurements.’ And she took a ribbon out of her pocket, marked in inches, and began measuring the ground, and sticking little pegs in here and there.  \n\n‘At the end of two yards,’ she said, putting in a peg to mark the distance, ‘I shall give you your directions––have another biscuit?’  \n\n‘No, thank you,’ said Alice: ‘one’s quite enough!’ ‘Thirst quenched, I hope?’ said the Queen.  \n\nAlice did not know what to say to this, but luckily the Queen did not wait for an answer, but went on. ‘At the end of three yards I shall repeat them––for fear of your forgetting them. At the end of four, I shall say good-bye. And at the end of five, I shall go!’  \n\nShe had got all the pegs put in by this time, and Alice looked on with great",

And at the end of five, I shall go!’  \n\nShe had got all the pegs put in by this time, and Alice looked on with great interest as she returned to the tree, and then began slowly walking down the row.  \n\nAt the two-yard peg she faced round, and said ‘A pawn goes two squares in its first move, you know. So you’ll go very quickly through the Third Square––by railway, I should think––and you’ll find yourself in the Fourth Square in no time. Well, that square belongs to Tweedledum and Tweedledee––the Fifth is mostly water––the Sixth belongs to Humpty Dumpty––But you make no remark?’  \n\n‘I––I didn’t know I had to make one––just then,’ Alice faltered out.  \n\n‘You should have said,’ the Queen went on in a tone of grave reproof, ‘“It’s extremely kind of you to tell me all this”–– however, we’ll suppose it said––the Seventh Square is all forest––however, one of the Knights will show you the way–– and in the Eighth Square we shall be Queens together, and it’s all feasting and fun!’ Alice got up and curtseyed, and sat down again.  \n\nAt the next peg the Queen turned again, and this time she said ‘Speak in French when you ca’n’t think of the English for a thing––turn out your toes as you walk––and remember who you are!’ She did not wait for Alice to curtsey, this time, but walked on quickly to the next peg, where she turned for a moment to say ‘Good-bye,’ and then hurried on to the last.  \n\nHow it happened, Alice never knew, but exactly as she came to the last peg, she was gone.\\* Whether she vanished into the air, or whether she ran quickly into the wood (‘and she can run very fast!’ thought Alice), there was no way of guessing, but she was gone, and Alice began to remember that she was a Pawn, and that it would soon be time for her to move.  \n\n# CHAPTER III  \n\nlooking-glass insects  \n\nOf course the first thing to do was to make a grand survey of the country she was going to travel through. ‘It’s something very like learning geography,’ thought Alice, as she stood on tiptoe in hopes of being able to see a little further. ‘Principal rivers––there are none. Principal mountains––I’m on the only one, but I don’t think it’s got any name. Principal towns ––why, what are those creatures, making honey down there? They ca’n’t be bees––nobody ever saw bees a mile off, you know——’ and for some time she stood silent, watching one of them that was bustling about among the flowers, poking its proboscis into them, ‘just as if it was a regular bee,’ thought Alice.  \n\nHowever, this was anything but a regular bee: in fact, it was an elephant––as Alice soon found out, though the idea quite took her breath away at first. ‘And what enormous flowers they must be!’ was her next idea. ‘Something like cottages with the roofs taken off, and stalks put to them––and what quantities of honey they must make! I think I’ll go down and––no, I wo’n’t go just yet,’ she went on, checking herself just as she was beginning to run down the hill, and trying to find some excuse for turning shy so suddenly. ‘It’ll never do to go down among them without a good long branch to brush them away––and what fun it’ll be when they ask me how I liked my walk. I shall say “Oh, I liked it well enough— —” (here  came  the  favourite  little  toss  of  the head), “only it was so dusty and hot, and the elephants did tease so!”  \n\n‘I think I’ll go down the other way,’ she said after a pause; ‘and perhaps I may visit the elephants later on. Besides, I do so want to get into the Third Square!’  \n\nSo, with this excuse, she ran down the hill, and jumped over the first of the six little brooks.\\*  \n\n![](images/image_24.jpg)  \n\n‘Tickets, please!’ said the Guard, putting his head in at the window. In a moment everybody was holding out a ticket: they were about the same size as the people, and quite seemed to fill the carriage.  \n\n‘Now then! Show your ticket, child!’ the Guard went on, looking angrily at Alice. And a great many voices all said together (‘like the chorus of a song,’ thought Alice) ‘Don’t keep him waiting, child! Why, his time is worth a thousand pounds a minute!’\\*  \n\n‘I’m afraid I haven’t got one,’ Alice said in a frightened tone: ‘there wasn’t a ticket-office where I came from.’ And again the chorus of voices went on. ‘There wasn’t room for one where she came from. The land there is worth a thousand pounds an inch!’  \n\n‘Don’t make excuses,’ said the Guard: ‘you should have bought one from the engine-driver.’ And once more the chorus of voices went on with ‘The man that drives the engine. Why, the smoke alone is worth a thousand pounds a puff!’  \n\nAlice thought to herself ‘Then there’s no use in speaking.’ The voices didn’t join in, this",

Why, the smoke alone is worth a thousand pounds a puff!’  \n\nAlice thought to herself ‘Then there’s no use in speaking.’ The voices didn’t join in, this time, as she hadn’t spoken, but, to her great surprise, they all thought in chorus (I hope you understand what thinking in chorus means––for I must confess that $I$ don’t), ‘Better say nothing at all. Language is worth a thousand pounds a word!’  \n\n‘I shall dream about a thousand pounds to-night, I know I shall!’ thought Alice.  \n\nAll this time the Guard was looking at her, first through a telescope, then through a microscope, and then through an opera-glass. At last he said ‘You’re traveling the wrong way, and shut up the window, and went away.  \n\n![](images/image_25.jpg)  \n\n‘So young a child,’ said the gentleman sitting opposite to her,\\* (he was dressed in white paper,) ‘ought to know which way she’s going, even if she doesn’t know her own name!’  \n\nA Goat, that was sitting next to the gentleman in white, shut his eyes and said in a loud voice, ‘She ought to know her way to the ticket-office, even if she doesn’t know her alphabet!  \n\nThere was a Beetle sitting next the Goat (it was a very queer carriage-full of passengers altogether), and, as the rule seemed to be that they should all speak in turn, he went on with ‘She’ll have to go back from here as luggage!’  \n\nAlice couldn’t see who was sitting beyond the Beetle, but a hoarse voice spoke next. ‘Change engines— ’ it said, and there it choked and was obliged to leave off.  \n\n‘It sounds like a horse,’ Alice thought to herself. And an extremely small voice, close to her ear, said ‘You might make a joke on that––something about “horse” and “hoarse,” you know.’  \n\nThen a very gentle voice in the distance said, ‘She must be labeled “Lass, with care,” you know——  \n\nAnd after that other voices went on (‘What a number of people there are in the carriage!’ thought Alice), saying ‘She must go by post, as she’s got a head on her——’\\* ‘She must be sent as a message by the telegraph——’ ‘She must draw the train herself the rest of the way— —,’ and so on.  \n\nBut the gentleman dressed in white paper leaned forwards and whispered in her ear, ‘Never mind what they all say, my dear, but take a return-ticket every time the train stops.’  \n\n‘Indeed I sha’n’t!’ Alice said rather impatiently. ‘I don’t belong to this railway journey at all––I was in a wood just now––and I wish I could get back there!’  \n\n‘You might make a joke on that,’ said the little voice close to her ear: ‘something about “you would if you could, you know”.’  \n\n‘Don’t tease so,’ said Alice, looking about in vain to see where the voice came from. ‘If you’re so anxious to have a joke made, why don’t you make one yourself?’  \n\nThe  little  voice  sighed  deeply.  It  was  very  unhappy, evidently, and Alice would have said something pitying to comfort it, ‘if it would only sigh like other people!’ she thought. But this was such a wonderfully small sigh, that she wouldn’t have heard it at all, if it hadn’t come quite close to her ear. The consequence of this was that it tickled her ear very much, and quite took off her thoughts from the unhappiness of the poor little creature.  \n\n‘I know you are a friend,’ the little voice went on: ‘a dear friend, and an old friend. And you wo’n’t hurt me, though I am an insect.’  \n\n‘What kind of insect?’ Alice inquired, a little anxiously. What she really wanted to know was, whether it could sting or not, but she thought this wouldn’t be quite a civil question to ask.  \n\n‘What,  then  you  don’t––––’ the little voice began, when it was drowned by a shrill scream from the engine, and everybody jumped up in alarm, Alice among the rest.  \n\nThe Horse, who had put his head out of the window, quietly drew it in and said ‘It’s only a brook we have to jump over.’ Everybody seemed satisfied with this, though Alice felt a little nervous at the idea of trains jumping at all. ‘However, it’ll take us into the Fourth Square, that’s some comfort!’ she said to herself. In another moment she felt the carriage rise straight up into the air, and in her fright she caught at the thing nearest to her hand, which happened to be the Goat’s beard.\\*  \n\n![](images/image_26.jpg)  \n\nBut the beard seemed to melt away as she touched it, and she found herself sitting quietly under a tree\\*––while the Gnat\\* (for that was the insect she had been talking to) was balancing itself on a twig just over her head, and fanning her with its wings.  \n\nIt certainly was a very large Gnat: ‘about the size of a chicken,’ Alice thought. Still, she couldn’t feel nervous with it, after they had been talking together so long.  \n\n‘––then you don’t like all insects?’ the Gnat went on,",

Still, she couldn’t feel nervous with it, after they had been talking together so long.  \n\n‘––then you don’t like all insects?’ the Gnat went on, as quietly as if nothing had happened.  \n\n‘I like them when they can talk,’ Alice said. ‘None of them ever talk, where $I$ come from.’  \n\n‘What sort of insects do you rejoice in, where you come from?’ the Gnat inquired.  \n\n‘I don’t rejoice in insects at all,’ Alice explained, ‘because I’m rather afraid of them––at least the large kinds. But I can tell you the names of some of them.’  \n\n‘Of course they answer to their names?’ the Gnat remarked carelessly.  \n\n‘I never knew them do it.’  \n\n‘What’s the use of their having names,’ the Gnat said, ‘if they wo’n’t answer to them?’  \n\n‘No use to them,’ said Alice; ‘but it’s useful to the people that name them, I suppose. If not, why do things have names at all?  \n\n‘I ca’n’t say,’ the Gnat replied. ‘Further on, in the wood down there, they’ve got no names––however, go on with your list of insects: you’re wasting time.’  \n\n‘Well, there’s the Horse-fly,’ Alice began, counting off the names on her fingers.  \n\n‘All right,’ said the Gnat. ‘Half way up that bush, you’ll see a Rocking-horse-fly, if you look. It’s made entirely of wood, and gets about by swinging itself from branch to branch.’  \n\n![](images/image_27.jpg)  \n\n‘What does it live on?’ Alice asked, with great curiosity.   \n‘Sap and sawdust,’ said the Gnat. ‘Go on with the list.  \n\nAlice looked at the Rocking-horse-fly with great interest, and made up her mind that it must have been just repainted, it looked so bright and sticky; and then she went on.  \n\n‘And there’s the Dragon-fly.’  \n\n‘Look on the branch above your head,’ said the Gnat, ‘and there you’ll find a Snap-dragon-fly. Its body is made of plumpudding, its wings of holly-leaves, and its head is a raisin burning in brandy.’\\*  \n\n![](images/image_28.jpg)  \n\n‘And what does it live on?’ Alice asked, as before.  \n\n‘Frumenty\\* and mince-pie,’ the Gnat replied; ‘and it makes its nest in a Christmas-box.’  \n\n‘And then there’s the Butterfly,’ Alice went on, after she had taken a good look at the insect with its head on fire, and had thought to herself, ‘I wonder if that’s the reason insects are so fond of flying into candles––because they want to turn into Snap-dragon-flies!’  \n\n‘Crawling at your feet,’ said the Gnat (Alice drew her feet back in some alarm), ‘you may observe a Bread-and-butterfly. Its wings are thin slices of bread-and-butter, its body is a crust, and its head is a lump of sugar.’  \n\n![](images/image_29.jpg)  \n\n‘And what does it live on?’ ‘Weak tea with cream in it.’  \n\nA new difficulty came into Alice’s head. ‘Supposing it couldn’t find any?’ she suggested.  \n\n‘Then it would die, of course.’  \n\n‘But that must happen very often,’ Alice remarked thoughtfully.  \n\n‘It always happens,’ said the Gnat.  \n\nAfter this, Alice was silent for a minute or two, pondering. The Gnat amused itself meanwhile by humming round and round her head: at last it settled again and remarked ‘I suppose you don’t want to lose your name?’  \n\n‘No, indeed,’ Alice said, a little anxiously.  \n\n‘And yet I don’t know,’ the Gnat went on in a careless tone: ‘only think how convenient it would be if you could manage to go home without it! For instance, if the governess wanted to call you to your lessons, she would call out “Come here— and there she would have to leave off, because there wouldn’t be any name for her to call, and of course you wouldn’t have to go, you know.’  \n\n‘That would never do, I’m sure,’ said Alice: ‘the governess would never think of excusing me lessons for that. If she couldn’t remember my name, she’d call me “Miss,” as the servants do.’  \n\n‘Well, if she said “Miss,” and didn’t say anything more,’ the Gnat remarked, ‘of course you’d miss your lessons. That’s a joke. I wish you had made it.  \n\n‘Why do you wish $I$ had made it?’ Alice asked. ‘It’s a very bad one.’  \n\nBut the Gnat only sighed deeply, while two large tears came rolling down its cheeks.  \n\n‘You shouldn’t make jokes,’ Alice said, ‘if it makes you so unhappy.’  \n\nThen came another of those melancholy little sighs, and this time the poor Gnat really seemed to have sighed itself away, for, when Alice looked up, there was nothing whatever to be seen on the twig, and, as she was getting quite chilly with sitting still so long, she got up and walked on.  \n\nShe very soon came to an open field, with a wood on the",

However, on second thoughts, she made up her mind to go on: ‘for I certainly won’t go back,’ she thought to herself, and this was the only way to the Eighth Square.  \n\n‘This must be the wood,’ she said thoughtfully to herself, ‘where things have no names. I wonder what’ll become of my name when I go in? I shouldn’t like to lose it at all——because they’d have to give me another, and it would be almost certain to be an ugly one. But then the fun would be, trying to find the creature that had got my old name! That’s just like the advertisements,  you  know,  when  people  lose  dogs— “answers to the name of ‘Dash’: had on a brass collar”— just fancy calling everything you met “Alice,” till one of them answered! Only they wouldn’t answer at all, if they were wise.’  \n\nShe was rambling on in this way when she reached the wood: it looked very cool and shady. ‘Well, at any rate it’s a great comfort,’ she said as she stepped under the trees, ‘after being so hot, to get into the––into the––into what?’ she went on, rather surprised at not being able to think of the word. ‘I mean to get under the––under the––under this, you know!’ putting her hand on the trunk of the tree. ‘What does it call itself, I wonder? I do believe it’s got no name––why, to be sure it hasn’t!’  \n\nShe stood silent for a minute, thinking: then she suddenly began again. ‘Then it really has happened, after all! And now, who am I? I will remember, if I can! I’m determined to do it!’ But being determined didn’t help her much, and all she could say, after a great deal of puzzling, was ‘L, I know it begins with L!’\\*  \n\nJust then a Fawn came wandering by: it looked at Alice with its large gentle eyes, but didn’t seem at all frightened. ‘Here then! Here then!’ Alice said, as she held out her hand and tried to stroke it; but it only started back a little, and then stood looking at her again.  \n\n‘What do you call yourself?’ the Fawn said at last. Such   \na soft sweet voice it had! ‘I wish I knew!’ thought poor Alice. She answered, rather   \nsadly, ‘Nothing, just now.’ ‘Think again,’ it said: ‘that wo’n’t do.’ Alice thought, but nothing came of it. ‘Please, would you   \ntell me what you call yourself?’ she said timidly. ‘I think that   \nmight help a little.’ ‘I’ll tell you, if you’ll come a little further on,’ the Fawn  \n\nsaid. ‘I ca’n’t remember here.’ So they walked on together through the wood, Alice with her arms clasped lovingly round the soft neck of the Fawn, till they came out into another open field, and here the Fawn gave a sudden bound into the air, and shook itself free from Alice’s arm. ‘I’m a Fawn!’ it cried out in a voice of delight. ‘And, dear me! you’re a human child!’ A sudden look of alarm came into its beautiful brown eyes, and in another moment it had darted away at full speed.  \n\n![](images/image_30.jpg)  \n\nAlice stood looking after it, almost ready to cry with vexation at having lost her dear little fellow-traveler so suddenly. ‘However, I know my name now,’ she said: ‘that’s some comfort. Alice––Alice––I wo’n’t forget it again. And now, which of these finger-posts ought I to follow, I wonder?’  \n\nIt was not a very difficult question to answer, as there was only one road through the wood, and the two finger-posts both pointed along it. ‘I’ll settle it,’ Alice said to herself, ‘when the road divides and they point different ways.’  \n\nBut this did not seem likely to happen. She went on and on, a long way, but, wherever the road divided, there were sure to be two finger-posts pointing the same way, one marked ‘TO TWEEDLEDUM’S HOUSE,’ and the other ‘TO THE HOUSE OF TWEEDLEDEE.’  \n\n‘I do believe,’ said Alice at last, ‘that they live in the same house! I wonder I never thought of that before––But I ca’n’t stay there long. I’ll just call and say “How d’ye do?” and ask them the way out of the wood. If I could only get to the Eighth Square before it gets dark!’ So she wandered on, talking to herself as she went, till, on turning a sharp corner, she came upon two fat little men, so suddenly that she could not help starting back, but in another moment she recovered herself, feeling sure that they must be\\*",
