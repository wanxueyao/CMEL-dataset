Experimental results show that this strategy narrows down the gap between the F1 score in evaluation and the dice loss in training. With the proposed training objective, we observe significant performance boosts over a wide range of data imbalanced NLP tasks. Notably, we are able to achieve SOTA results on CTB5, CTB6 and UD1.4 for the part of speech tagging task, and competitive or even better results on CoNLL03, OntoNotes5.0, MSRA and OntoNotes4.0 for the named entity recognition task along with the machine reading comprehension and paraphrase identification tasks.

This gap isnâ€™t a big issue for balanced datasets, but is extremely detrimental if a big proportion of training examples are easy-negative ones: easy-negative examples can easily dominate training since their probabilities can be pushed to 0 fairly easily. Meanwhile, the model can hardly distinguish between hardnegative examples and positive ones, which has a huge negative effect on the final F1 performance. cient to a more general case. Given two sets $A$ and $B$ , tversky index is computed as follows: $$ \\mathrm{TI}=\\frac{|A\\cap B|}{|A\\cap B|+\\alpha|A\\backslash B|+\\beta|B\\backslash A|} $$ Tversky index offers the flexibility in controlling the tradeoff between false-negatives and falsepositives.

The models listed are BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), BERT+FL, BERT+DL, BERT+DSC, XLNet (Yang et al., 2019), XLNet+FL, XLNet+DL, and XLNet+DSC. For the MRPC task, the F1 scores are as follows: BERT has an F1 score of 88.0, BERT+FL has 88.43 (+0.43), BERT+DL has 88.71 (+0.71), and BERT+DSC has 88.92 (+0.92). For the QQP task, the F1 scores are: BERT has an F1 score of 91.3, BERT+FL has 91.86 (+0.56), BERT+DL has 91.92 (+0.62), and BERT+DSC has 92.11 (+0.81). For XLNet, the F1 scores are: XLNet has an F1 score of 89.2 for MRPC and 91.8 for QQP, XLNet+FL has 89.25 (+0.05) for MRPC and 92.31 (+0.51) for QQP, XLNet+DL has 89.33 (+0.13) for MRPC and 92.39 (+0.59) for QQP, and XLNet+DSC has 89.78 (+0.58) for MRPC and 92.60 (+0.79) for QQP. The table highlights the performance boost obtained by adding different loss functions to BERT and XLNet.",
