  <data key="d1">"The image is a black-and-white illustration depicting a scene from the story of Alice in Wonderland. It shows Alice, a young girl with long hair, swimming in a pool of tears. She is looking at a mouse that is also swimming in the pool. The mouse appears to be bristling and has a displeased expression on its face. The background is minimalistic, with horizontal lines suggesting the surface of the water and vertical lines indicating the walls of the pool. The overall atmosphere is one of tension and discomfort, as Alice tries to make conversation with the mouse, which clearly does not appreciate the topic of cats."</data>
