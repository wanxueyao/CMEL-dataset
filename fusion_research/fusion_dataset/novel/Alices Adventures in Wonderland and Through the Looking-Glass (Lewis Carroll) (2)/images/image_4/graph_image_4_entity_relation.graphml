  <data key="d1">"The image is a black-and-white illustration depicting a whimsical scene from 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.' The central figure is Alice, who is sitting on the ground with her back to the viewer. She is surrounded by a variety of animals and birds, all appearing wet and disheveled, suggesting they have just emerged from a pool of water. To the left of Alice, there is a large bird with long feathers, possibly an eagle or a vulture, standing upright. Next to it is a smaller bird with a round body and a short beak, which could be a duck. In front of Alice, there is a mouse standing on its hind legs, looking up at her. To the right of the mouse, there is a crab with its claws raised. Behind the crab, there are two more birds, one with a long neck and another with a rounded body. Further back, there is a large owl with its wings slightly spread. The background is filled with other birds and animals, all appearing damp and somewhat distressed. The overall atmosphere of the image conveys a sense of confusion and discomfort, as if the characters are trying to make sense of their current situation."</data>
