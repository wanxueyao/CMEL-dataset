They were the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such nonsense.  \n\nMr. Dursley was the director of a Łrm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors.  \n\nThe Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no Łner boy anywhere.  \n\nThe Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn’t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing with a child like that.  \n\nWhen Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs.  Dursley  gossiped  away  happily  as  she  wrestled  a screaming Dudley into his high chair.  \n\nNone of them noticed a large, tawny owl łutter past the window.  \n\nAt half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. “Little tyke,” chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four’s drive.  \n\nIt was on the corner of the street that he noticed the Łrst sign of something peculiar—a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn’t realize what he had seen—then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive—no, looking at the sign; cats couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.  \n\nBut on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traŃc jam, he couldn’t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn’t bear people who dressed in funny clothes—the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his Łngers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close  by.  They  were  whispering  excitedly  together.  Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt— these people were obviously collecting for something...yes, that would be it. The traŃc moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.  \n\nMr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his oŃce on the ninth łoor.",

But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt— these people were obviously collecting for something...yes, that would be it. The traŃc moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.  \n\nMr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his oŃce on the ninth łoor. If he hadn’t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn’t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at Łve diŀerent people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he’d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.  \n\nHe’d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker’s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn’t know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn’t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying.  \n\n“The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard—”  \n\n“—yes, their son, Harry—”  \n\nMr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear łooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.  \n\nHe dashed back across the road, hurried up to his oŃce, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost Łnished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking...no, he was being stupid.  \n\nPotter wasn’t such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew was called Harry. He’d never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didn’t blame her—if he’d had a sister like that...but all the same, those people in cloaks...  \n\nHe found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at Łve o’clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door.  \n\n“Sorry,” he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn’t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, “Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!”  \n\nAnd the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked oŀ.  \n\nMr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set oŀ for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn’t approve of imagination.  \n\nAs he pulled into the driveway of number four, the Łrst thing he saw—and it didn’t improve his mood—was the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.  \n\n“Shoo!” said Mr. Dursley loudly.  \n\nThe cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.  \n\nMrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door’s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (“Won’t!”). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news:  \n\n“And Łnally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation’s owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds łying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.” The newscaster allowed himself a grin. “Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuŃn with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?”  \n\n“Well, Ted,” said the weatherman, “I don’t know about that, but it’s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today",

Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?”  \n\n“Well, Ted,” said the weatherman, “I don’t know about that, but it’s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they’ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating BonŁre Night early—it’s not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.”  \n\nMr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls łying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters...  \n\nMrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He’d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. “Er—Petunia, dear—you haven’t heard from your sister lately, have you?”  \n\nAs he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn’t have a sister.  \n\n“No,” she said sharply. “Why?”  \n\n“Funny  stuŀ  on  the  news,”  Mr.  Dursley  mumbled. “Owls...shooting stars...and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today...”  \n\n“So?” snapped Mrs. Dursley.  \n\n“Well,  I  just  thought...maybe...it  was  something  to  do with...you know...her crowd.”  \n\nMrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he’d heard the name “Potter.” He decided he didn’t dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, “Their son—he’d be about Dudley’s age now, wouldn’t he?”  \n\n“I suppose so,” said Mrs. Dursley stińy.  \n\n“What’s his name again? Howard, isn’t it?”  \n\n“Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.”  \n\n“Oh, yes,” said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. “Yes, I quite agree.”  \n\nHe didn’t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr.  \n\nDursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something.  \n\nWas he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did...if it got out that they were related to a pair of—well, he didn’t think he could bear it.  \n\nThe Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind....He couldn’t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on—he yawned and turned over —it couldn’t aŀect them....  \n\n# How very wrong he was.  \n\nMr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes Łxed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.  \n\nA man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d just popped out of the ground. The cat’s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.  \n\nNothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken  at  least  twice.  This  man’s  name  was  Albus Dumbledore.  \n\nAlbus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, “I should have known.”  \n\nHe found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He łicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop",

He chuckled and muttered, “I should have known.”  \n\nHe found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He łicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again—the next lamp łickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn’t be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set oŀ down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it.  \n\n“Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.”  \n\nHe turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruńed.  \n\n“How did you know it was me?” she asked.  \n\n“My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stińy.”  \n\n“You’d be stiŀ if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all day,” said Professor McGonagall.  \n\n“All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.”  \n\nProfessor McGonagall sniŀed angrily.  \n\n“Oh  yes,  everyone’s  celebrating,  all  right,”  she  said impatiently. “You’d think they’d be a bit more careful, but no— even the Muggles have noticed something’s going on. It was on their news.” She jerked her head back at the Dursleys’ dark living-room window. “I heard it. Flocks of owls...shooting stars....Well, they’re not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent—I’ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.”  \n\n“You can’t blame them,” said Dumbledore gently. “We’ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.”  \n\n“I know that,” said Professor McGonagall irritably. “But that’s no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.”  \n\nShe threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn’t, so she went on. “A Łne thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?”  \n\n“It certainly seems so,” said Dumbledore. “We have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?”  \n\n“A what?”  \n\n“A lemon drop. They’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m rather fond of.”  \n\n“No,  thank  you,”  said  Professor  McGonagall  coldly,  as though she didn’t think this was the moment for lemon drops. “As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone—”  \n\n“My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this ‘You-Know-Who’ nonsense —for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.” Professor McGonagall łinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. “It all gets so confusing if we keep saying ‘You-Know-Who.’ I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort’s name.”  \n\n“I know you haven’t,” said Professor McGonagall, sounding half  exasperated,  half  admiring.  “But  you’re  diŀerent. Everyone knows you’re the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.”  \n\n“You łatter me,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Voldemort had powers I will never have.”  \n\n“Only because you’re too—well—noble to use them.”  \n\n“It’s lucky it’s dark. I haven’t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuŀs.”  \n\nProfessor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, “The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are łying around. You know what everyone’s saying? About why he’s disappeared? About what Łnally stopped him?”  \n\nIt seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she Łxed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever “everyone” was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told",

About what Łnally stopped him?”  \n\nIt seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she Łxed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever “everyone” was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.  \n\n“What they’re saying,” she pressed on, “is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric’s Hollow. He went to Łnd the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are—are— that they’re—dead.”  \n\nDumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.  \n\n“Lily and James...I can’t believe it...I didn’t want to believe it...Oh, Albus...”  \n\nDumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. “I know...I know...” he said heavily.  \n\nProfessor McGonagall’s voice trembled as she went on. “That’s not all. They’re saying he tried to kill the Potters’ son, Harry. But—he couldn’t. He couldn’t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they’re saying that when he couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow broke—and that’s why he’s gone.”  \n\nDumbledore nodded glumly.  \n\n“It’s—it’s true?” faltered Professor McGonagall. “After all he’s done...all the people he’s killed...he couldn’t kill a little boy? It’s just astounding...of all the things to stop him...but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?”  \n\n“We can only guess,” said Dumbledore. “We may never know.”  \n\nProfessor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniŀ as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, “Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was he who told you I’d be here, by the way?”  \n\n“Yes,” said Professor McGonagall. “And I don’t suppose you’re going to tell me why you’re here, of all places?”  \n\n“I’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They’re the only family he has left now.”  \n\n“You don’t mean—you can’t mean the people who live here?” cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four. “Dumbledore—you can’t. I’ve been watching them all day. You couldn’t Łnd two people who are less like us. And they’ve got this son—I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!”  \n\n“It’s the best place for him,” said Dumbledore Łrmly. “His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he’s older. I’ve written them a letter.”  \n\n“A letter?” repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. “Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He’ll be famous—a legend—I wouldn’t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in the future—there will be books written about Harry—every child in our world will know his name!”  \n\n“Exactly,” said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses. “It would be enough to turn any boy’s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won’t even remember! Can’t you see how much better oŀ he’ll be, growing up away from all that until he’s ready to take it?”  \n\nProfessor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, “Yes—yes, you’re right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?” She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.  \n\n“Hagrid’s bringing him.”  \n\n“You think it—wise—to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?”  \n\n“I would trust Hagrid with my life,” said Dumbledore.  \n\n“I’m not saying his heart isn’t in the right place,” said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, “but you can’t pretend he’s not careless. He does tend to—what was that?”  \n\nA low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky—and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.  \n\nIf the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least Łve times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild—long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins.

He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild—long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets.  \n\n“Hagrid,” said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. “At last. And where did you get that motorcycle?”  \n\n“Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,” said the giant, climbing carefully oŀ the motorcycle as he spoke. “Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I’ve got him, sir.”  \n\n“No problems, were there?”  \n\n“No, sir—house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin’ around. He fell asleep as we was łyin’ over Bristol.”  \n\nDumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.  \n\n“Is that where—?” whispered Professor McGonagall. “Yes,” said Dumbledore. “He’ll have that scar forever.”  \n\n“Couldn’t you do something about it, Dumbledore?”  \n\n“Even if I could, I wouldn’t. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well—give him here, Hagrid—we’d better get this over with.”  \n\nDumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys’ house.  \n\n“Could I—could I say good-bye to him, sir?” asked Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must  have  been  a  very  scratchy,  whiskery  kiss.  Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.  \n\n“Shhh!”  hissed  Professor  McGonagall,  “you’ll  wake  the Muggles!”  \n\n“S-s-sorry,”  sobbed  Hagrid,  taking  out  a  large,  spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. “But I c-c-can’t stand it—Lily an’ James dead—an’ poor little Harry oŀ ter live with Muggles—”  \n\n“Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we’ll be found,” Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry’s blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone out.  \n\n“Well,”  said  Dumbledore  Łnally,  “that’s  that.  We’ve  no business staying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.”  \n\n“Yeah,” said Hagrid in a very muńed voice, “I’d best get this bike  away.  G’night,  Professor  McGonagall—Professor Dumbledore, sir.”  \n\nWiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and oŀ into the night.  \n\n“I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,” said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.  \n\nDumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.  \n\n“Good luck, Harry,” he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.  \n\nA breeze ruńed the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs. Dursley’s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley....He couldn’t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: “To Harry Potter—the boy who lived!”  \n\n![](images/image_4.jpg)  \n\nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to Łnd their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive",

The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys’ front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing diŀerentcolored bonnets—but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his Łrst bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.  \n\nYet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the Łrst noise of the day.  \n\n“Up! Get up! Now!”  \n\nHarry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.  \n\n“Up!” she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a łying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he’d had the same dream before.  \n\nHis aunt was back outside the door.  \n\n“Are you up yet?” she demanded.  \n\n“Nearly,” said Harry.  \n\n“Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don’t you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on  \n\nDuddy’s birthday.”  \n\nHarry groaned.  \n\n“What did you say?” his aunt snapped through the door.  \n\n“Nothing, nothing...”  \n\nDudley’s birthday—how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider oŀ one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.  \n\nWhen he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley’s birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new  computer  he  wanted,  not  to  mention  the  second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated  exercise—unless  of  course  it  involved  punching somebody. Dudley’s favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn’t often catch him. Harry didn’t look it, but he was very fast.  \n\nPerhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley’s, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the Łrst question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.  \n\n“In the car crash when your parents died,” she had said. “And don’t ask questions.”  \n\nDon’t ask questions—that was the Łrst rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys.  \n\nUncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.  \n\n“Comb your hair!” he barked, by way of a morning greeting.  \n\nAbout once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no diŀerence, his hair simply grew that way—all over the place.  \n\nHarry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel—Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.  \n\nHarry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was diŃcult as there wasn’t much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His face fell.  \n\n“Thirty-six,” he said, looking up at his mother and father. “That’s two less than last year.”  \n\n“Darling, you haven’t counted Auntie Marge’s present, see, it’s here under this big one from Mummy and Daddy.”  \n\n“All right, thirty-seven",

His face fell.  \n\n“Thirty-six,” he said, looking up at his mother and father. “That’s two less than last year.”  \n\n“Darling, you haven’t counted Auntie Marge’s present, see, it’s here under this big one from Mummy and Daddy.”  \n\n“All right, thirty-seven then,” said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolŁng down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.  \n\nAunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, “And we’ll buy you another two presents while we’re out today. How’s that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right?”  \n\nDudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, “So I’ll have thirty...thirty...”  \n\n“Thirty-nine, sweetums,” said Aunt Petunia.  \n\n“Oh.” Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. “All right then.”  \n\nUncle Vernon chuckled.  \n\n“Little tyke wants his money’s worth, just like his father. ’Atta boy, Dudley!” He ruńed Dudley’s hair.  \n\nAt that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper oŀ a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.  \n\n“Bad news, Vernon,” she said. “Mrs. Figg’s broken her leg. She can’t take him.” She jerked her head in Harry’s direction.  \n\nDudley’s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry’s heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley’s birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she’d ever owned.  \n\n“Now what?” said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he’d planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn’t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again.  \n\n“We could phone Marge,” Uncle Vernon suggested.  \n\n“Don’t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.”  \n\nThe Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn’t there—or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn’t understand them, like a slug.  \n\n“What about what’s-her-name, your friend—Yvonne?”  \n\n“On vacation in Majorca,” snapped Aunt Petunia.  \n\n“You could just leave me here,” Harry put in hopefully (he’d be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley’s computer).  \n\nAunt Petunia looked as though she’d just swallowed a lemon.  \n\n“And come back and Łnd the house in ruins?” she snarled.  \n\n“I won’t blow up the house,” said Harry, but they weren’t listening.  \n\n“I suppose we could take him to the zoo,” said Aunt Petunia slowly, “...and leave him in the car....”  \n\n“That car’s new, he’s not sitting in it alone....”  \n\nDudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn’t really crying— it had been years since he’d really cried—but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted.  \n\n“Dinky Duddydums, don’t cry, Mummy won’t let him spoil your special day!” she cried, łinging her arms around him.  \n\n“I...don’t...want...him...t-t-to come!” Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. “He always sp-spoils everything!” He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother’s arms.  \n\nJust then, the doorbell rang—“Oh, good Lord, they’re here!” said Aunt Petunia frantically—and a moment later, Dudley’s best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people’s arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.  \n\nHalf an hour later, Harry, who couldn’t believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys’ car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the Łrst time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn’t been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they’d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.  \n\n“I’m warning you,” he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry’s, “I’m warning you now, boy—any funny business, anything at all—and you’ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.”  \n\n“I’m not going to do anything,” said Harry, “honestly...” But Uncle Vernon didn’t believe him.

No one ever did.  \n\nThe problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn’t make them happen.  \n\nOnce, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn’t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left “to hide that horrible scar.” Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to Łnd his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it oŀ. He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn’t explain how it had grown back so quickly.  \n\nAnother time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley’s (brown with orange puŀ balls). The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until Łnally it might have Łtted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn’t Łt Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn’t punished.  \n\nOn the other hand, he’d gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley’s gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry’s surprise as anyone else’s, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry’s headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he’d tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump.  \n\nBut today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn’t school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg’s cabbage-smelling living room.  \n\nWhile he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles.  \n\n“...roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,” he said, as a motorcycle overtook them.  \n\n“I  had  a  dream  about  a  motorcycle,”  said  Harry, remembering suddenly. “It was łying.”  \n\nUncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: “MOTORCYCLES DON’T FLY!”  \n\nDudley and Piers sniggered.  \n\n“I know they don’t,” said Harry. “It was only a dream.”  \n\nBut he wished he hadn’t said anything. If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn’t, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon—they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas.  \n\nIt was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families.  The  Dursleys  bought  Dudley  and  Piers  large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn’t bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn’t blond.  \n\nHarry had the best morning he’d had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn’t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn’t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to Łnish the Łrst.  \n\nHarry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last.  \n\nAfter lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted  to  see  huge,  poisonous  cobras  and  thick,  mancrushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon’s car and crushed it into a trash can—but at the moment it didn’t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.  \n\nDudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils.  \n\n“Make it move,” he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn",

In fact, it was fast asleep.  \n\nDudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils.  \n\n“Make it move,” he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn’t budge.  \n\n“Do it again,” Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.  \n\n“This is boring,” Dudley moaned. He shuńed away.  \n\nHarry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn’t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself—no company except stupid people drumming their Łngers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.  \n\nThe snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry’s.  \n\nIt winked.  \n\nHarry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren’t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.  \n\nThe snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly:  \n\n“I get that all the time.”  \n\n“I know,” Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn’t sure the snake could hear him. “It must be really annoying.”  \n\nThe snake nodded vigorously.  \n\n“Where do you come from, anyway?” Harry asked.  \n\nThe snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it.  \n\nBoa Constrictor, Brazil.  \n\n“Was it nice there?”  \n\nThe boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoos. “Oh, I see— so you’ve never been to Brazil?”  \n\nAs the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump. “DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON’T BELIEVE WHAT IT’S DOING!”  \n\nDudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.  \n\n“Out of the way, you,” he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete łoor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened —one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror.  \n\nHarry  sat  up  and  gasped;  the  glass  front  of  the  boa constrictor’s  tank  had  vanished.  The  great  snake  was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the łoor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits.  \n\nAs the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low,  hissing  voice  said,  “Brazil,  here  I  come....Thanksss, amigo.”  \n\nThe keeper of the reptile house was in shock.  \n\n“But the glass,” he kept saying, “where did the glass go?”  \n\nThe zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn’t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten oŀ his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, “Harry was talking to it, weren’t you, Harry?”  \n\nUncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, “Go—cupboard—stay—no meals,” before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.  \n\nHarry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn’t know what time it was and he couldn’t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn’t risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food.  \n\nHe’d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he’d been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn’t remember being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding łash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn’t imagine where all the green light came from. He couldn’t remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house.  \n\nWhen he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the D",

He couldn’t remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house.  \n\nWhen he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wildlooking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look.  \n\nAt school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley’s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley’s gang.  \n\n![](images/image_5.jpg)  \n\n# T  \n\nhe escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, Łrst time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches.  \n\nHarry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley’s gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley’s favorite sport: Harry Hunting.  \n\nThis was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going oŀ to secondary school and, for the Łrst time in his life, he wouldn’t be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon’s old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny.  \n\n“They stuŀ people’s heads down the toilet the Łrst day at Stonewall,”  he  told  Harry.  “Want  to  come  upstairs  and practice?”  \n\n“No, thanks,” said Harry. “The poor toilet’s never had anything as horrible as your head down it—it might be sick.” Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he’d said.  \n\nOne day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg’s. Mrs. Figg wasn’t as bad as usual. It turned out she’d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn’t seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she’d had it for several years.  \n\nThat evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and łat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren’t looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life.  \n\nAs he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruńy that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn’t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn’t trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.  \n\nThere was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water.  \n\n“What’s this?” he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question.  \n\n“Your new school uniform,” she said.  \n\nHarry looked in the bowl again.  \n\n“Oh,” he said, “I didn’t realize it had to be so wet.”  \n\n“Don’t be stupid,” snapped Aunt Petunia. “I’m dyeing some of Dudley’s old things gray for you. It’ll look just like everyone else’s when I’ve Łnished.”  \n\nHarry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his Łrst day at Stonewall High— like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably.  \n\nDudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry’s new uniform.

He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his Łrst day at Stonewall High— like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably.  \n\nDudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry’s new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table.  \n\nThey heard the click of the mail slot and łop of letters on the doormat.  \n\n“Get the mail, Dudley,” said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.  \n\n“Make Harry get it.”  \n\n“Get the mail, Harry.”  \n\n“Make Dudley get it.”  \n\n“Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.”  \n\nHarry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon’s sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and— $\\boldsymbol{a}$ letter for Harry.  \n\nHarry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives—he didn’t belong to the library, so he’d never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:  \n\nMr. H. Potter   \nThe Cupboard under the Stairs   \n4 Privet Drive   \nLittle Whinging   \nSurrey  \n\nThe  envelope  was  thick  and  heavy,  made  of  yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp.  \n\nTurning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter $H$ .  \n\n“Hurry up, boy!” shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. “What are you doing, checking for letter bombs?” He chuckled at his own joke.  \n\nHarry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope.  \n\nUncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and łipped over the postcard.  \n\n“Marge’s ill,” he informed Aunt Petunia. “Ate a funny whelk...”  \n\n“Dad!” said Dudley suddenly. “Dad, Harry’s got something!”  \n\nHarry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon.  \n\n“That’s mine!” said Harry, trying to snatch it back.  \n\n“Who’d be writing to you?” sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster than a set of traŃc lights. And it didn’t stop there. Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge.  \n\n“P-P-Petunia!” he gasped.  \n\nDudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the Łrst line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made a choking noise.  \n\n“Vernon! Oh my goodness—Vernon!”  \n\nThey stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn’t used to being ignored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.  \n\n“I want to read that letter,” he said loudly.  \n\n“I want to read it,” said Harry furiously, “as it’s mine.”  \n\n“Get out, both of you,” croaked Uncle Vernon, stuŃng the letter back inside its envelope.  \n\nHarry didn’t move.  \n\n“I WANT MY LETTER!” he shouted.  \n\n“Let me see it!” demanded Dudley.  \n\n“OUT!” roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruŀs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent Łght over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay łat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and łoor.  \n\n“Vernon,” Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, “look at the address—how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don’t think they’re watching the house?”  \n\n“Watching—spying—might  be  following  us,”  muttered Uncle Vernon wildly.  \n\n“But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we don’t want—”  \n\nHarry could see Uncle Vernon’s shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen.  \n\n“No,” he said Łnally. “No, we’ll ignore it. If they don’t get an answer....Yes, that’s best...we won’t do anything....”  \n\n“But—”  \n\n“I’m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn’t we swear when  we  took  him  in  we’d  stamp  out  that  dangerous nonsense?”  \n\nThat evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he’d never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard.  \n\n“Where’s my",

Didn’t we swear when  we  took  him  in  we’d  stamp  out  that  dangerous nonsense?”  \n\nThat evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he’d never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard.  \n\n“Where’s my letter?” said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. “Who’s writing to me?”  \n\n“No one. It was addressed to you by mistake,” said Uncle Vernon shortly. “I have burned it.”  \n\n“It was not a mistake,” said Harry angrily, “it had my cupboard on it.”  \n\nSILENCE!” yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful.  \n\n“Er—yes, Harry—about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been thinking...you’re really getting a bit big for it...we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley’s second bedroom.”  \n\n“Why?” said Harry.  \n\n“Don’t ask questions!” snapped his uncle. “Take this stuŀ upstairs, now.”  \n\nThe Dursleys’ house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon’s sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn’t Łt into his Łrst bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor’s dog; in the corner was Dudley’s Łrst-ever television set, which he’d put his foot through when his favorite  program  had  been  canceled;  there  was  a  large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air riłe, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only things in the room that looked as though they’d never been touched.  \n\nFrom downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, “I don’t want him in there...I need that room...make him get out....”  \n\nHarry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he’d have given anything to be up here. Today he’d rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it.  \n\nNext morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock. He’d screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn’t have his room back. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he’d opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly.  \n\nWhen the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, “There’s another one! ‘Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive—’”  \n\nWith a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made diŃcult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused Łghting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry’s letter clutched in his hand.  \n\n“Go to your cupboard—I mean, your bedroom,” he wheezed at Harry. “Dudley—go—just go.”  \n\nHarry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn’t received his Łrst letter. Surely that meant they’d try again? And this time he’d make sure they didn’t fail. He had a plan.  \n\nThe repaired alarm clock rang at six o’clock the next morning. Harry turned it oŀ quickly and dressed silently. He mustn’t wake the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights.  \n\nHe was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four Łrst. His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door—  \n\n“AAAAARRRGH!”  \n\nHarry leapt into the air; he’d trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat—something alive!  \n\nLights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncle’s face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn’t do exactly what he’d been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuńed miserably oŀ into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon’s lap. Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink.  \n\n“I want",

Harry shuńed miserably oŀ into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon’s lap. Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink.  \n\n“I want—” he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes.  \n\nUncle Vernon didn’t go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot.  \n\n“See,” he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, “if they can’t deliver them they’ll just give up.”  \n\n“I’m not sure that’ll work, Vernon.”  \n\n“Oh, these people’s minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they’re not like you and me,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.  \n\nOn Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldn’t go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced  through  the  small  window  in  the  downstairs bathroom.  \n\nUncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out. He hummed “Tiptoe Through the Tulips” as he worked, and jumped at small noises.  \n\nOn Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post oŃce and the dairy trying to Łnd someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor.  \n\n“Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?” Dudley asked Harry in amazement.  \n\nOn Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy.  \n\n“No post on Sundays,” he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, “no damn letters today  \n\nSomething came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the Łreplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one—  \n\n“Out! OUT!”  \n\nUncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing oŀ the walls and łoor.  \n\n“That does it,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. “I want you all back here in Łve minutes ready to leave. We’re going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments!”  \n\nHe looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. Dudley was snińing in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag.  \n\nThey drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn’t dare ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while.  \n\n“Shake ’em oŀ...shake ’em oŀ,” he would mutter whenever he did this.  \n\nThey didn’t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling. He’d never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he’d missed Łve television programs he’d wanted to see, and he’d never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer.  \n\nUncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering....  \n\nThey ate stale cornłakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day. They had just Łnished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table.  \n\n“’Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an ’undred of these at the front desk.”  \n\nShe held up a letter so they could read the green ink address:  \n\nMr. H. Potter Room 17 Railview Hotel Cokeworth  \n\nHarry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared.  \n\n“I’ll take them,” said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following her from the dining room.  \n\n“Wouldn’t it be better just to go home, dear?” Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn’t seem to hear her. Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and oŀ they went again.

Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and oŀ they went again. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed Łeld, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage.  \n\n“Daddy’s gone mad, hasn’t he?” Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared.  \n\nIt started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dudley sniveled.  \n\n“It’s Monday,” he told his mother. “The Great Humberto’s on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with a television.”  \n\nMonday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday—and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days of the week, because of television—then tomorrow, Tuesday,  was  Harry’s  eleventh  birthday.  Of  course,  his birthdays were never exactly fun—last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon’s old socks. Still, you weren’t eleven every day.  \n\nUncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long, thin package and didn’t answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he’d bought.  \n\n“Found the perfect place!” he said. “Come on! Everyone out!”  \n\nIt was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no television in there.  \n\n“Storm forecast for tonight!” said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together. “And this gentleman’s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!”  \n\nA toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below them.  \n\n“I’ve already got us some rations,” said Uncle Vernon, “so all aboard!”  \n\nIt was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house.  \n\nThe inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the Łreplace was damp and empty. There were only two rooms.  \n\nUncle Vernon’s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas. He tried to start a Łre but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.  \n\n“Could do with some of those letters now, eh?” he said cheerfully.  \n\nHe was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn’t cheer him up at all.  \n\nAs night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a Łerce wind rattled the Łlthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went oŀ to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to Łnd the softest bit of łoor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.  \n\nThe storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry couldn’t sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley’s snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of Dudley’s watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he’d be eleven in ten minutes’ time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.  \n\nFive minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the roof wasn’t going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he’d be able to steal one somehow.  \n\nThree minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea?  \n\nOne  minute  to  go  and  he’d  be  eleven.  Thirty seconds...twenty...ten...nine—maybe he’d wake Dudley up, just to annoy him—three...two...one...  \n\nBOOM.  \n\nThe whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in.  \n\n![](images/image_6.jpg)  \n\n![](images/image_7.jpg)  \n\n“Where’s the cannon?” he said stupidly.  \n\nThere was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the room.

He was holding a riłe in his hands— now they knew what had been in the long, thin package he had brought with them.  \n\n“Who’s there?” he shouted. “I warn you—I’m armed!” There was a pause. Then—  \n\nSMASH!  \n\nThe door was hit with such force that it swung clean oŀ its hinges and with a deafening crash landed łat on the łoor.  \n\nA giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair.  \n\nThe giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and Łtted it easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. He turned to look at them all.  \n\n“Couldn’t make us a cup ${\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{o}}}^{\\prime}$ tea, could yeh? It’s not been an easy journey....”  \n\nHe strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear.  \n\n“Budge up, yeh great lump,” said the stranger.  \n\nDudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching, terriŁed, behind Uncle Vernon.  \n\n“An’ here’s Harry!” said the giant.  \n\nHarry looked up into the Łerce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.  \n\n“Las’ time I saw you, you was only a baby,” said the giant. “Yeh look a lot like yer dad, but yeh’ve got yer mum’s eyes.”  \n\nUncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.  \n\n“I demand that you leave at once, sir!” he said. “You are breaking and entering!”  \n\n“Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,” said the giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon’s hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room.  \n\nUncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.  \n\n“Anyway—Harry,” said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, “a very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here—I mighta sat on it at some point, but it’ll taste all right.”  \n\nFrom an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box. Harry opened it with trembling Łngers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing.  \n\nHarry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, “Who are you?”  \n\nThe giant chuckled.  \n\n“True, I haven’t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.”  \n\nHe held out an enormous hand and shook Harry’s whole arm.  \n\n“What about that tea then, eh?” he said, rubbing his hands together. “I’d not say no ter summat stronger if yeh’ve got it, mind.”  \n\nHis eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted. He bent down over the Łreplace; they couldn’t see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring Łre there. It Łlled the whole damp hut with łickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he’d sunk into a hot bath.  \n\nThe giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the Łrst six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley Łdgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, “Don’t touch anything he gives you, Dudley.”  \n\nThe giant chuckled darkly.  \n\n“Yer great puddin’ of a son don’ need fattenin’ anymore, Dursley, don’ worry.”  \n\nHe passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn’t take his eyes oŀ the giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, “I’m sorry, but I still don’t really know who you are.”  \n\nThe giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.  \n\n“Call me Hagrid,” he said, “everyone does. An’ like I told yeh, I’m Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts—yeh’ll know all about Hogwarts, o’ course.”  \n\n“Er—no,” said Harry.  \n\nHagrid looked shocked.  \n\n“Sorry,” Harry said quickly.  \n\n“Sorry?” barked Hagrid,",

I knew yeh weren’t gettin’ yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn’t even know abou’ Hogwarts, fer cryin’ out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yer parents learned it all?”  \n\n“All what?” asked Harry.  \n\n“ALL  WHAT?”  Hagrid  thundered.  “Now  wait  jus’  one second!”  \n\nHe had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to Łll the whole hut. The Dursleys were cowering against the wall.  \n\n“Do you mean ter tell me,” he growled at the Dursleys, “that this  boy—this  boy!—knows  nothin’  abou’—about ANYTHING?”  \n\nHarry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after all, and his marks weren’t bad.  \n\n“I know some things,” he said. “I can, you know, do math and stuŀ.”  \n\nBut Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, “About our world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents’ world.”  \n\n“What world?”  \n\nHagrid looked as if he was about to explode.  \n\n“DURSLEY!” he boomed.  \n\nUncle  Vernon,  who  had  gone  very  pale,  whispered something that sounded like “Mimblewimble.” Hagrid stared wildly at Harry.  \n\n“But yeh must know about yer mum and dad,” he said. “I mean, they’re famous. You’re famous.”  \n\n“What? My—my mum and dad weren’t famous, were they?”  \n\n“Yeh don’ know...yeh don’ know...” Hagrid ran his Łngers through his hair, Łxing Harry with a bewildered stare.  \n\n“Yeh don’ know what yeh are?” he said Łnally.  \n\nUncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.  \n\n“Stop!” he commanded. “Stop right there, sir! I forbid you to tell the boy anything!”  \n\nA braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with rage.  \n\n“You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An’ you’ve kept it from him all these years?”  \n\n“Kept what from me?” said Harry eagerly.  \n\n“STOP! I FORBID YOU!” yelled Uncle Vernon in panic.  \n\nAunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror.  \n\n“Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,” said Hagrid. “Harry—yer a wizard.”  \n\nThere was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard.  \n\n“I’m a what?” gasped Harry.  \n\n“A wizard, o’ course,” said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, “an’ a thumpin’ good’un, I’d say, once yeh’ve been trained up a bit. With a mum an’ dad like yours, what else would yeh be? An’ I reckon it’s abou’ time yeh read yer letter.”  \n\nHarry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read:  \n\nHOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY Headmaster: Albus Dumbledore  \n\n(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards)  \n\nDear Mr. Potter,  \n\nWe are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.  \n\nTerm begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31.  \n\nYours sincerely, Minerva McGonagall, Deputy Headmistress  \n\nQuestions exploded inside Harry’s head like Łreworks and he couldn’t decide which to ask Łrst. After a few minutes he stammered, “What does it mean, they await my owl?”  \n\n“Gallopin’ Gorgons, that reminds me,” said Hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl—a real, live, rather ruńed-looking owl—a long quill, and a roll of parchment. With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down:  \n\nDear Professor Dumbledore, Given Harry his letter. Taking him to buy his things tomorrow. Weather’s horrible. Hope you’re well.  \n\nHagrid  \n\nHagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he came back and sat down as",

Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone.  \n\nHarry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly.  \n\n“Where was I?” said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the Łrelight.  \n\n“He’s not going,” he said.  \n\nHagrid grunted.  \n\n“I’d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,” he said.  \n\n“A what?” said Harry, interested.  \n\n“A Muggle,” said Hagrid, “it’s what we call non-magic folk like them. An’ it’s your bad luck you grew up in a family o’ the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.”  \n\n“We swore when we took him in we’d put a stop to that rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon, “swore we’d stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!”  \n\n“You knew?” said Harry. “You knew I’m a—a wizard?”  \n\n“Knew!” shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. “Knew! Of course we knew! How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter just like that and disappeared oŀ to that—that school—and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the only one who saw her for what she was—a freak! But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in the family!”  \n\nShe stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years.  \n\n“Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you, and of course I knew you’d be just the same, just as strange, just as—as—abnormal—and then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you!”  \n\nHarry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said, “Blown up? You told me they died in a car crash!”  \n\n“CAR CRASH!” roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. “How could a car crash kill Lily an’ James Potter? It’s an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin’ his own story when every kid in our world knows his name!”  \n\n“But why? What happened?” Harry asked urgently.  \n\nThe anger faded from Hagrid’s face. He looked suddenly anxious.  \n\n“I never expected this,” he said, in a low, worried voice. “I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin’ hold of yeh, how much yeh didn’t know. Ah, Harry, I don’ know if I’m the right person ter tell yeh—but someone’s gotta—yeh can’t go oŀ ter Hogwarts not knowin’.”  \n\nHe threw a dirty look at the Dursleys.  \n\n“Well, it’s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh—mind, I can’t tell yeh everythin’, it’s a great myst’ry, parts of it....”  \n\nHe sat down, stared into the Łre for a few seconds, and then said, “It begins, I suppose, with—with a person called—but it’s incredible yeh don’t know his name, everyone in our world knows—”  \n\n“Who?”  \n\n“Well—I don’ like sayin’ the name if I can help it. No one does.”  \n\n“Why not?”  \n\n“Gulpin’ gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is diŃcult. See, there was this wizard who went...bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was...”  \n\nHagrid gulped, but no words came out.  \n\n“Could you write it down?” Harry suggested.  \n\n“Nah—can’t  spell  it.  All  right—Voldemort.”  Hagrid shuddered. “Don’ make me say it again. Anyway, this—this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookin’ fer followers. Got ’em, too—some were afraid, some just wanted a bit o’ his power, ’cause he was gettin’ himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didn’t know who ter trust, didn’t dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches...terrible things happened. He was takin’ over. ’Course, some stood up to him— an’ he killed ’em. Horribly. One o’ the only safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore’s the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn’t dare try takin’ the school, not jus’ then, anyway.  \n\n“Now, yer mum an’ dad were as good a witch an’ wizard as I ever knew. Head boy an’ girl at Hogwarts in their day!

Suppose the myst’ry is why You-Know-Who never tried to get ’em on his  side  before...probably  knew  they  were  too  close  ter Dumbledore ter want anythin’ ter do with the Dark Side.  \n\n“Maybe he thought he could persuade ’em...maybe he just wanted ’em outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old. He came ter yer house an’—an’—”  \n\nHagrid  suddenly  pulled  out  a  very  dirty,  spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn.  \n\n“Sorry,” he said. “But it’s that sad—knew yer mum an’ dad, an’ nicer people yeh couldn’t Łnd—anyway...  \n\n“You-Know-Who killed ’em. An’ then—an’ this is the real myst’ry of the thing—he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin’ by then. But he couldn’t do it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That’s what yeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh—took care of yer mum an’ dad an’ yer house, even—but it didn’t work on you, an’ that’s why yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived after he decided ter kill ’em, no one except you, an’ he’d killed some o’ the best witches an’ wizards of the age—the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts—an’ you was only a baby, an’ you lived.”  \n\nSomething very painful was going on in Harry’s mind. As Hagrid’s story came to a close, he saw again the blinding łash of green light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it before—and he remembered something else, for the Łrst time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh.  \n\nHagrid was watching him sadly.  \n\n“Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore’s orders. Brought yeh ter this lot...”  \n\n“Load of old tosh,” said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his Łsts were clenched.  \n\n“Now, you listen here, boy,” he snarled, “I accept there’s something  strange  about  you,  probably  nothing  a  good beating wouldn’t have cured—and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no denying it, and the world’s better oŀ without them in my opinion—asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types—just what I expected, always knew they’d come to a sticky end—”  \n\nBut at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said, “I’m warning you, Dursley —I’m warning you—one more word...”  \n\nIn danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded  giant,  Uncle  Vernon’s  courage  failed  again;  he łattened himself against the wall and fell silent.  \n\n“That’s better,” said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the łoor.  \n\nHarry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them.  \n\n“But what happened to Vol-, sorry—I mean, You-KnowWho?”  \n\n“Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That’s the biggest myst’ry, see...he was gettin’ more an’ more powerful— why’d he go?  \n\n“Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say he’s still out there, bidin’ his time, like, but I don’ believe it. People who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of ’em came outta kinda trances. Don’ reckon they could’ve done if he was comin’ back.  \n\n“Most of us reckon he’s still out there somewhere but lost his powers. Too weak to carry on. ’Cause somethin’ about you Łnished him, Harry. There was somethin’ goin’ on that night he hadn’t counted on—I dunno what it was, no one does—but somethin’ about you stumped him, all right.”  \n\nHagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He’d spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn’t they been turned into warty toads every time they’d tried to lock him in his cupboard? If he’d once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been able to kick",

If he’d once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football?  \n\n“Hagrid,” he said quietly, “I think you must have made a mistake. I don’t think I can be a wizard.”  \n\nTo his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.  \n\n“Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or angry?”  \n\nHarry looked into the Łre. Now he came to think about it...every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry...chased by Dudley’s gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach...dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, he’d managed to make it grow back...and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn’t he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn’t he set a boa constrictor on him?  \n\nHarry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him.  \n\n“See?” said Hagrid. “Harry Potter, not a wizard—you wait, you’ll be right famous at Hogwarts.”  \n\nBut Uncle Vernon wasn’t going to give in without a Łght.  \n\n“Haven’t I told you he’s not going?” he hissed. “He’s going to Stonewall High and he’ll be grateful for it. I’ve read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish—spell books and wands and—”  \n\n“If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won’t stop him,” growled Hagrid. “Stop Lily an’ James Potter’s son goin’ ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His name’s been down ever since he was born. He’s oŀ ter the Łnest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he won’t know himself. He’ll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an’ he’ll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had, Albus Dumbled—”  \n\n“I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!” yelled Uncle Vernon.  \n\nBut he had Łnally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head, “NEVER—” he thundered, “— INSULT—ALBUS—DUMBLEDORE—IN—FRONT—OF—ME!”  \n\nHe brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley—there was a łash of violet light, a sound like a Łrecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig’s tail poking through a hole in his trousers.  \n\nUncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other room, he cast one last terriŁed look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them.  \n\nHagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard.  \n\n“Shouldn’ta lost me temper,” he said ruefully, “but it didn’t work anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasn’t much left ter do.”  \n\nHe cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows.  \n\n“Be grateful if yeh didn’t mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts,” he said. “I’m—er—not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin’. I was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an’ get yer letters to yeh an’ stuŀ—one o’ the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job—”  \n\n“Why aren’t you supposed to do magic?” asked Harry.  \n\n“Oh,  well—I  was  at  Hogwarts  meself  but  I—er—got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wand in half an’ everything. But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great man, Dumbledore.”  \n\n“Why were you expelled?”  \n\n“It’s gettin’ late and we’ve got lots ter do tomorrow,” said Hagrid loudly. “Gotta get up ter town, get all yer books an’ that.”  \n\nHe took oŀ his thick black coat and threw it to Harry.  \n\n“You can kip under that,” he said. “Don’ mind if it wriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o’ dormice in one o’ the pockets.”  \n\n![](images/image_8.jpg)  \n\narry woke early the next morning. Although he could tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight.  \n\n“It was a dream,” he told himself Łrmly. “I dreamed a giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I open my eyes I’ll be at home in my cupboard.”  \n\nThere was suddenly a loud tapping noise.  \n\nAnd  there’s  Aunt  Petunia  knocking  on  the  door,  Harry thought, his heart sinking.

The hut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its beak.  \n\nHarry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it open. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn’t wake up. The owl then łuttered onto the łoor and began to attack Hagrid’s coat.  \n\n“Don’t do that.”  \n\nHarry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak Łercely at him and carried on savaging the coat.  \n\n“Hagrid!” said Harry loudly. “There’s an owl—”  \n\n“Pay him,” Hagrid grunted into the sofa.  \n\n“What?”  \n\n“He wants payin’ fer deliverin’ the paper. Look in the pockets.”  \n\nHagrid’s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets— bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags...Łnally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins.  \n\n“Give him Łve Knuts,” said Hagrid sleepily.  \n\n“Knuts?”  \n\n“The little bronze ones.”  \n\nHarry counted out Łve little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it. Then he łew oŀ through the open window.  \n\nHagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.  \n\n“Best be oŀ, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an’ buy all yer stuŀ fer school.”  \n\nHarry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture.  \n\n“Um—Hagrid?”  \n\n“Mm?” said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots.  \n\n“I haven’t got any money—and you heard Uncle Vernon last night...he won’t pay for me to go and learn magic.”  \n\n“Don’t worry about that,” said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head. “D’yeh think yer parents didn’t leave yeh anything?”  \n\n“But if their house was destroyed—”",
