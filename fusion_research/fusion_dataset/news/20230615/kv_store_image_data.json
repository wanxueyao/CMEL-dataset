These structures are arranged in a grid pattern and are housed within a spacious, high-ceilinged building with a metal framework. The centrifuges are predominantly beige or light brown in color and are equipped with metallic supports and wiring. Some of the centrifuges are covered with protective casings, while others are exposed. On the left side of the image, an American flag is prominently displayed, hanging from a metal structure. The overall atmosphere suggests a high-tech, industrial setting, possibly related to nuclear energy production. The ceiling is composed of large metal panels, and there are various pipes and conduits running along the walls and ceiling, indicating a complex infrastructure.",

The x-axis represents the years, starting from 2000 and ending at 2023, with markers at every five-year interval. The y-axis represents the interest rate in percentage, ranging from 0% to 7%. The data points are connected by an orange line, showing fluctuations in the interest rate over time. There are three shaded areas labeled 'RECESSIONS', indicating periods of economic recession. The first recession period is between 2001 and 2002, the second one is around 2008, and the third one is around 2020. The graph shows a significant drop in the interest rate during each recession period, followed by a gradual increase. Notably, the interest rate reached its peak at approximately 6% in 2000, dropped to around 1% during the 2008 recession, and remained close to 0% until 2020. After 2020, there is a sharp increase in the interest rate, reaching around 5% by the end of 2023. The graph also includes a note stating 'No change' near the end of the timeline, indicating that the interest rate might remain stable or unchanged after 2023.",
