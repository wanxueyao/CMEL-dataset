  <data key="d1">"The image is a black-and-white illustration depicting a scene from the story of Alice in Wonderland. It shows Alice, a young girl with long hair tied back, standing to the right side of the image. She is wearing a dress with puffed sleeves and a full skirt. Alice is engaged in the act of grooming the Red Queen, who is seated on the left side of the image. The Queen is depicted as an older woman with a round face, wearing a crown and a robe that appears to be wrapped around her body. Her expression is one of discomfort or frustration, and she is holding a scepter in her left hand. Alice is carefully adjusting the Queen's hair, which is disheveled and tangled. The background is dark and shadowy, adding to the dramatic effect of the scene. The overall atmosphere conveys a sense of tension and awkwardness, as Alice tries to help the Queen with her appearance."</data>
