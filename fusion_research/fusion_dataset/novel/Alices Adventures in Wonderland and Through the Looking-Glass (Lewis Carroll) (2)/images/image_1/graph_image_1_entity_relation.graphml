  <data key="d1">"The image is a black-and-white illustration depicting a scene from the classic story 'Alice in Wonderland.' The main character, Alice, is shown kneeling on the ground with her hand resting on her chin, deep in thought. She has long, flowing hair and is dressed in a dress with puffed sleeves and a full skirt. Her posture and expression convey a sense of curiosity and contemplation. To her left, there is a small rabbit standing upright, facing away from Alice. The rabbit appears to be wearing a waistcoat and holding a watch, which are characteristic features of the White Rabbit from the story. The background is a simple, darkened area that contrasts with the lighter figure of Alice, emphasizing her as the focal point of the image. The overall atmosphere is one of wonder and confusion, reflecting Alice's state of mind as she tries to make sense of her strange surroundings."</data>
