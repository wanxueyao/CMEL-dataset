There are ten bomblets arranged side by side, each with a conical nose and a cylindrical body featuring multiple fins. The bomblets appear to be made of metal and show signs of wear and rust, indicating they have been exposed to the elements.

The City Council bought about 17,000 acres of farmland 60 miles to the north, near Fort Collins, along with the associated water rights. When the time was right, Thornton would divert the water from the Cache la Poudre River that irrigated that farmland, put it in a pipeline and send it downstate. “In the water business you have to be years and years ahead of the game,” Mr. Ethredge, now retired, said in an interview.
