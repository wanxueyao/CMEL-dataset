  <data key="d1">"The image is a black-and-white illustration depicting two anthropomorphic characters in a whimsical scene. On the left, there is a character resembling a frog, dressed in a formal outfit with a high collar and a coat that has buttons. This character has a round face, large eyes, and powdered hair that curls all over its head. It stands on a step, holding a large envelope with a crown seal, suggesting it is an official document or letter. On the right, there is another character resembling a fish, also dressed in a formal outfit with a high collar and a coat. This character has a long, thin body and a tail, and it appears to be handing over the envelope to the frog-like character. The background shows a tree and part of a building, indicating that the scene takes place outdoors near a house. The overall atmosphere is surreal and fantastical, with the characters' exaggerated features and the unusual interaction adding to the whimsical tone."</data>
