  <data key="d1">"The image is a black and white illustration of a rat. The rat is depicted in a dynamic pose, with its front paws raised as if it is climbing or reaching for something. Its eyes are wide open, and its mouth is slightly agape, giving it an expression of determination or effort. The rat's fur is detailed with numerous lines to show texture and volume. Its tail is long and segmented, extending outwards from the bottom of the image. The background consists of horizontal lines, suggesting a surface or wall that the rat is interacting with. There is a small object near the rat's nose, which appears to be a piece of thread or string. The overall atmosphere conveyed by the image is one of action and focus, as the rat seems to be engaged in a task that requires concentration and effort."</data>
